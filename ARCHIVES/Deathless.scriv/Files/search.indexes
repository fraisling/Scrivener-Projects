            <Title>Social Structure and the Compact</Title>
            <Text>Social Structure in the Confederacy

The social structure of the Confederacy as defined by the Compact is very strongly stratified. It consists of a hard hierarchy of status, at the top of which stands the Dragon-King and the Royal Family, followed by the Noble Houses, the Common Mages, the Knighthood, the Gentry, the Bourgeoisie, the Serfs, and lastly the Outcast.
The top tier, the Royal Family and the Dragon-King who stands at the head of it, has absolute authority. They can dictate the laws of the state, negotiate with other states, and generally do as they wish. The only laws they are absolutely bound by are the Anathema and, ostensibly, the Compact, which limits how some of the classes can be treated, even by the Royal Family and Dragon-King, though the Compact is far less stringently defined and enforced then the Anathema. 
The next tier of the social hierarchy, the Noble Houses, are comprised of the most powerful Mage families. These families are key to the strength of the Confederacy as only a very scant few of the most powerful mages have the potential to ascend to become dragons themselves. The Nobles are charged with the enforcement of the Law within the state and the administration of the state itself. Each House is given charge of a region within the state to govern in accordance with the wishes of the Royal Family. The Noble Houses also provide the manpower for the Dragon-King’s corp of Battlemages, the most prestigious of the state’s military orders. The Noble Families also pay annual tithes from their income to support the Royal Family and the state as a whole.
The Common Mages are a relatively small class within the greater Confederacy, comprised of those low-born citizens who have completed the requirements to become full mages without being sufficiently powerful to have been adopted by one of the Noble Houses. Even mages born of the serf class are elevated to this class, because of the value of magecraft. While they lack the power to serve within the Battlemages or to be of use to the Noble Houses, they are artificers, alchemists, magical craftsmen, healers, and the like, using their magic to enhance and improve the lives of the citizenry. The demand for their services and the value placed on them means that they tend to accumulate great wealth and immense influence among the lower classes. Like the Noble Houses, the Common Mages also pay an annual tithe of their income to the state or provide equivalent value in goods or services as determined appropriate by the Noble House that rules their region.
The Knighthood are in a strange position within the social structure of the Confederacy as they are, strictly speaking, the direct servants of the Royal Family and the Noble Houses. Their knighting ceremony includes swearing an oath of service to the Dragon-King, the state, and the Nobles that the Dragon-King has elevated. They frequently serve as officers within the military orders, distinguished by the addition of Knight to their military rank (Knight-General, Knight-Captain, etc). They are aristocrats raised by the merit of their service, holding legal authority over any non-mage commoner they encounter within the bounds of the Compact. This nominally places them between the Common Mages and the Gentry, as while the Common Mages hold no authority over anyone, neither do they answer to anyone shy of the Noble Houses. Knighthood, however, is not hereditary and the families of Knights are only considered even a marginal part of the aristocracy so long as the Knight lives. However, no child or spouse of a Knight can ever be less than Bourgeoisie short of being made a serf or outcast as punishment for a crime.
The Gentry are the wealthiest of the non-mages within the Confederacy. They are merchant-princes, master artisans, military officers, academics and the like. They are a pseudo-aristocracy within the common folk, with subtle distinctions between differing groups in the class. This is the landed class among the common folks. The have significant freedoms and equally significant responsibilities within the Confederacy as the Gentry are expected to provide well educated children to serve within the military orders as officers, both commissioned and non-commissioned, in addition to the same tithing requirements as the Common Mages. The Gentry are also the most educated of the common folks, with universities and academies available to them unrelated to the Collegium Arcanus which trains all mages within the Confederacy.
The Bourgeoisie are non-landed merchants, artisans, craftsmen and skilled laborers such as seafarers, carpenters, stonemasons, and the like. They are an educated class, though few if any ever manage entrance to the universities or academies available to the Gentry. The freedoms of the Bourgeoisie are less extensive, in no small part because of their lack of wealth, compared to the Gentry. Their responsibilities are also somewhat less onerous as they tithe the same way the Gentry and Common Mages do, and many of the younger sons of Bourgeoisie families are also like to enlist willingly within the various military orders and frequently excel within the military, occasionally even gaining commissions through excellence in service.
The final class considered part of the citizenry of the Confederacy are the Serfs. The rights and privileges of the serfs are limited. They are the common laborers of the Confederacy: farmers, miners, lumberjacks, quarry men, and animal tenders. They are kept fed and housed and paid a pittance of coin so that they could indulge in drink or other entertainment or the occasional luxury for their rest days. And serfs were granted a single rest day out of every week, being expected to work the other six unless they were too sick or injured to work. Serfs are considered valuable property by those whom they serve are provided medical and healing attention by their masters. Serfs may also be conscripted into state military orders as needed to fill out the ranks of common soldiers. 
The Outcasts are criminals, beggars, thieves, and those who have been otherwise cast out for one reason or another. They have no rights and no privileges. They have no legal existence within the Confederation at all. They live at the sufferance of those around them, as there is no penalty for killing an Outcast. Among serfs and the Bourgeoisie some Outcasts are tolerated, those who beg because of disability or infirmity that prevents them from being productive citizens mainly. These poor souls are left to the charity of those who will tolerate them.
Social Mobility within the Classes

In the Confederacy there is only one guaranteed way to escape the social class you are born into: becoming a mage. Because of the usefulness and relative rarity of magical talent, every child in every state of the Confederacy is tested for magical ability twice, once at age 13 and a second time at age 19. Testing positively results in the child being removed to the Collegium Arcanus, a school for training those with ability to become mages. The training of mages is difficult and intense and not all who enter the Collegium survive to graduate. Those that do graduate, however, will forever be mages. The most powerful mages tend to get adopted into the Noble Families, if they were not born of such to begin with. Otherwise they become Common Mages.
Other means of social advancement are more limited in scope, such as being granted a knighthood for service. Or a Bourgeoisie family achieving sufficient financial success that they marry into the Gentry or acquire lands of their own through other means and become ‘New Gentry’. Or an artisan becoming sufficiently famous to earn the patronage of a Noble House and being given land and wealth to become a part of the Gentry. Or a Common Mage marrying into a Noble House.  Or a Noble mage marrying into the lower rungs of the Royal Family. 
Magic notwithstanding, there is only one other way for a serf to escape into the upper classes, and even it is nigh impossible. They would have to be conscripted to the military and then perform some fantastic act of bravery or feat of arms that earned them a knighthood. Such acts from the common soldiery are so rare as to be nearly unheard of and even should such a thing happen, it may not even be recognized or rewarded.

Downward mobility is also possible beneath the ranks of the Mages. It is possible for a Knight to be stripped of his Knighthood in punishment for failing their duty or committing certain types of crimes. Or for a Gentry family to be stripped of their lands and wealth for committing certain offenses against the Nobility or Royalty or breaking the laws of the Confederacy or state. A Gentry family could fail, losing their wealth over the span of years or even generations to the point that they lose their lands and become Bourgeoisie. They could even fall so far into debt that the family is sold into serfdom to repay their debts. This can, and often does, happen to Bourgeoisie families as well, falling into serfdom through a failure of effort and wisdom. And anyone, even of the Nobility or Mages can become Outcast, though at their heights within the state, death is a far more common punishment for defiance of the law.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>Magic within the World of the Confederacy</Title>
            <Text>Magic is the single most important force within the Drakon Confederacy. It is the true power from which all other authority derives. And it is an absolute necessity to nurture and advance its power as much as possible for the security of the entire world. For just beyond the world, in the void between universes, dwell monstrosities that seek to destroy everything they encounter. These beings are manifestations of madness and decay, of entropy and chaos itself, and work tirelessly to eliminate all order from the cosmos, to return it all to primordial non-existence. It is only the power of Magic that gives the sentient races the ability to fight back against such Eldritch abominations. And at the pinnacle of mortal magic stand the Dragons. 
Dragons are not a normal creature of the natural world. Dragons do not reproduce the way other creatures do. Every Dragon begins its existence as part of one of the other sentient, magic using races, like humanity, elves, or a myriad of others. Some few of these races are born with a dragon-seed in their soul, giving them the potential to become Dragons, given time and good fortune. Becoming a Dragon is no easy process, it requires the accumulation of immense magical power, usually through the study and practice of magic over decades if not centuries. Such accumulation of power causes the dragon-seed within their soul to sprout and grow, changing them over time into Dragons in body and soul.
Every sentient being in this world has some potential to use magic, whether they bear a dragon-seed or not. The Drakon Confederacy has developed a means to safely and quickly assess this potential, a tool they call a Mage Stone. The one to be tested picks up the Mage Stone and holds it near their mouth, breathing out ten slow breaths onto the stone. Each breath causes to the stone to pulse with a slight glow, the light growing steadier and brighter with each breath. The color of the glow reveals the potential of the person being tested. The colors the stone produces are the colors of flame, the hotter the flame colors, the greater magical potential of the person. The scale ranges from the dark, cool reds, to ambers and oranges, yellows and whites, to blue and even violet at the hottest end of the scale.
Those with the weakest potential, the darkest red colors on the scale, lack the power to wield magic with any degree of skill or power and are never trained. Ambers and weaker oranges are not accepted for training on their first testing but all oranges are trained if it is their second testing.  The additional maturity gained in the intervening years serves to improve the odds of the trainees reaching graduation even if their potential has not developed to a higher level during that time. Bright oranges, yellows, and whites are always trained and few with potential of white or higher fail to find themselves pulled into a Noble House by the end of their training.  Blues are rare and are always trained to joined the Battlemages, the most powerful of various guilds. Violets are so rare as to be considered legendary because that color indicates an activated dragon-seed, which is to say one that has begun to sprout, however slightly. 
Unfortunately, only the Dragons know the truth about dragon-seeds. The Collegium Arcanus, where the mages are trained to use and explore their powers, merely believe that any sufficiently powerful mage can become a Dragon. The Dragons, however, can sense a dragon-seed whenever they are close enough to its bearer. For this reason, Dragons always take those who bear a dragon-seed under their wing and mentor them. They also tend to mentor an assortment of powerful Battlemages as well so as to mask the presence of actual dragon-seeds.
How the world’s magic works

Magic is powered by breath. Breath which overflows with the vital energies of the breather. The same breath which fuels muscles and movement and life. Ergo the more exhausted a person is from exertion, the less magic they can muster. Magic can be breathed into specially prepared objects: foci, relics, and artifacts, to power their magical abilities or it can be breathed into spell forms created by skilled mages in order to manifest supernatural effects. 
Spell forms come in two basic types: temporary constructs or permanent structures. The temporary constructs tend to be mental in nature, an envisioning of the geometric figures and runes that shape the power of magic into a manifest effect. Permanent structures are much more flexible in many ways, they can be tattooed on flesh, carved in stone, forged as a metal object, or any number of other physical creations. The advantage of such things is two-fold: they are faster to activate than a mental spell form and they do not require a complete understanding of the form itself to use. All spell forms have a common drawback, however, breathing magic into an incomplete or incorrectly formed results in backlash. Backlash generally manifests as the completely uncontrolled release of magical energy. This manifestation is usually an explosive process and becomes more dangerous the more energy is breathed into the form.
Breath itself comes in two basic forms: mortal breath and dragon breath. Mortal breath is less potent and less dense in magical energy. All sapient, non-dragon, lifeforms possess mortal breath, though the energy density of such breath varies with the power of the being breathing. Dragon breath, on the other hand, is far more powerful. It’s weakest degree of energy density is orders of magnitudes more potent than the strongest of mortal breath. Dragon breath is so dense with magical energy that it can be shaped into an exhalation of elemental energy with nothing more than thought and will. This is how Dragons breath out flames, ice, lightning or toxic gas at need. 
Those possessed of dragon seeds possess a small amount of dragon breath from the moment that the seed begins to sprout. As the seed sprouts and grows toward maturity, more and more of their mortal breath become dragon breath. At first, they may not understand this small well of intense power, but the process of becoming a dragon comes with a slowly growing understanding of what is happening to the nascent dragon. 
Foci, relics, and artifacts are the product of the artificer’s trade and represent three different grades of enchanted object. Foci, the simplest kind, contain a single spell form of relatively low complexity. They store no magic of their own, and are limited in their usefulness as a result. Relics are far more varied than foci, often containing multiple spell forms of differing complexity. Many relics possess a small to moderate reservoir that the wielder can breath power into and that keeps the relic operating without the active attention of the user. As such, relics can produce more passive effects than foci. 
Artifacts are the more powerful and rarest of magical items and are yet more complex than even the most potent of relics. The spell forms and enchantments laid on an artifact are layered to create effects far beyond what is possible in foci or relics and an artifact contains a much, much larger reservoir of power. A reservoir that is, in many cases, several times larger than the breath capacity of even the most powerful of mages. The bearers of such things often spent as much as a few hours each day breathing power back into the reservoirs of their artifacts to keep them topped up. The most common artifacts are the fantastic battle armor worn by the most powerful of Battlemages. Armor which is crafted by the Dragons for their most power weapons in the battle against the void-dwellers. Since these suits are powerful and difficult to destroy they become heirlooms within the families of those blessed with such gifts, with new suits created whenever the Dragons need to elevate a new Warlord.
While Warlord armor is relatively common as artifacts go, no more than a dozen or so might exist within even the oldest states of the Confederacy, and even fewer in the younger states. Other artifacts tend to be unique or nearly unique and vary greatly. Each artifact is crafted by a master artificer and many represent the culmination of a lifetime of pursuing the pinnacle of their craft. The most powerful artifacts tend to be infused with the very life of the crafter, who often die in the process of quickening the item. Only an artifact crafted by a Dragon-king can surpass such creations in power.
On power and potential

Within the Confederacy, all children are tested on their 13th and 19th birthdays for mage spark. This is because the breath and potential of a child grows within them from birth, but slowly until the beginning of puberty. The 13th birthday is the earliest time when that potential power might have crossed a threshold to be suitable for training and very few children are taken at this age for the Collegium. The first testing is mostly to establish a baseline of the child’s potential. The second testing, and the difference between it and the first testing, tell the true story of the child’s potential as a mage. 
A dragon seed is only detectable by the test if it has already begun to sprout. This is incredibly rare at the first testing, but usually indicates a Dragon with the potential to become a full Dragon-King in their own right.

            <Text>Malcolm Cole was born in the United States of America on planet Earth, a couple decades before the end of the 20th century. The eldest son of a lower middle class family, his young life was hard, marked by walking the edge of poverty among the Appalachian mountains. Malcolm was an intelligent boy, who often used books to escape the hardships of being poor in the 1980’s. Like most children of Generation X, Malcolm grew up an almost feral child, raised on trauma, sarcasm and neglect. 
Like many such young men, Malcolm fled into the Army seeking a better life then what his parents had. He served with distinction as a recon scout and sniper in several conflicts throughout his time in the regular army before being assigned to the Joint Special Operation Command and working with the US Intelligence Community. He left the service after an injury left him with chronic pain and weakness in one leg.
He spent his medical retirement working as a corporate security consultant before getting involved in social activism as he got older and American politics got increasingly conservative and repressive. </Text>

            <Title>Scene 1</Title>
            <Text>I knew it was a bad idea even as I slid my concealed carry holster into the waistband of my heavy duty dungarees. You don’t take a firearm to a protest. You just don’t do it. But the feeling in my gut told me this wasn’t going to be a peaceful demonstration no matter we did. And after what Rittenhouse did in Kenosha during the pandemic? I wasn’t going to be unarmed when the next right-wing douche canoe decided to start shooting at people.
A week ago, three white cops opened fire on an unarmed, unresisting black teenager during a traffic stop. They essentially killed a kid over a burned out rear blinker because one officer ‘felt threatened’. The city had been a powder keg ever since, and I was pretty sure the press conference was going to be the match that set it off.
I was headed downtown to join thousands of others, men and women of all colors, in protesting against the increasingly militarized city police. Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, hostilities between the increasingly fascist government and everyone who believed in empathy, compassion and keeping authorities accountable to the people had risen sharply. Rumors on the ‘net even suggested that a bunch of the same militant right-wing groups involved in the January 6 insurrection had traveled to the city over the last few days to ‘counter-protest’. It was bullshit, of course; they were here to intimidate and provoke violence if they could.
I stood for a long moment in front of my bedroom mirror and stared into my own eyes, just breathing. I wasn’t remotely typical among my liberal brethren who would be at this protest. I was older than most, one of those uncommon members of Gen-X who’d had enough of this bullshit, and a disabled veteran with a bum leg to boot. Far too many of my supposed peers would be on the other side of this conflict. I tried to focus on my breathing, pushing down my anxiety and the adrenaline that was trying to push me into a combat mindset. I had braided and beaded my long hair earlier and now I pulled the entire mass into a pony-tail that I tied tightly with a leather thong before pulling on my jacket.
“I will not start shit,” I affirmed to my reflection, beginning the mantra that I always repeated before tense protests like this one, “but neither will I take shit. I won’t be the first to resort to violence, but if violence comes upon me I will not hesitate. If today is the day, then may Odin grant me strength to stand firm, may the Morrigan give me the cunning to find victory, may Athena show me the wisest path to protect those who need protection, and may Tiamat and Abzu grant me the ferocity to make a difference.”
Behind me, at the open door to my bedroom, I heard my roommate half-snort and half-chuckle. “You are the only pagan I know who reveres war deities from four, very different pantheons as your main gods. The others are reciting the Wiccan Rede and Threefold Law, while you’re preparing to fight your way into Valhalla,” she half-scolded, half-joked.
“That’s because I’m not really a pagan. I don’t go in for witchcraft and magic spells. I’m a heathen, willing to fight, kill, and die for what I believe,” I retorted. It was an old routine between us. She was a die-hard pacifist and didn’t approve of my willingness to engage in violence. In this moment, I was just glad she hadn’t seen me slip the pistol into my pants. That would have been a very ugly argument. 
I turned back from the mirror to look back at her. She was shorter than me, younger than me, and much prettier than my old ass had ever been. She also had a much greater stake in what was going on, being neither white nor male. “Midi, please tell me you put the vest I gave you on under your sweatshirt?” I asked.
“Are you really gonna make an issue out of this, Malcolm?” she asked with a sigh. “You know how I feel about violence.”
I suppressed a small wince. If she was using that tone of voice and full naming me then she knew, or at least strongly suspected, what was under my jacket and disapproved. Intensely. At least she wasn’t making an issue of it. Yet.
“And you know how I feel about stupid risks. Expect peace but prepare for violence, whether you plan to be violent back or not,” I retorted. “There’s nothing in the Rede or Threefold Law that suggests protecting yourself is frowned upon. At least not protecting yourself in the passive, wearing a protective vest sense.”
She frowned. “You really think this is going to end in violence, don’t you?” 
“Yes,” the word leapt out of my mouth so fast that I almost interrupted her. “The red hats have been cranking up the pressure and pushing their fascist bullshit harder than ever. Unless something major gets shaken up, we’re heading toward another racial massacre that’ll make Tulsa look like a day in the park. And you know it.”
“Things aren’t anywhere near that bad yet,” she tried to argue.
“Aren’t they? Trump hasn’t even been back in office for a year yet. You remember how Pride went right?” I shot back. “It was almost Stonewall all over again. And we didn’t have Proud Boys and Oathkeepers open carrying AR-15s to deal with at Pride, just a bunch of homophobic and transphobic frat bros.”
“Wait, you really think those guys are going to be on the streets?” she seemed shocked. “I thought that was just a bunch of bullshit rumors.”
“Look, you know I still talk to a lot of old friends with the feds and military intelligence who aren’t Trumpster fires. They’re convinced the intel is solid. So go put on the goddamn vest or I will park myself in front of the apartment door and refuse to let you out.” The edge of anger colored my tone but I couldn’t help it. “I have too few friends to take the risk of letting you go without it.”
With another exasperated sigh, Midori recognized that I wasn’t budging on this. “Fine. I’m only doing this for your peace of mind, Mal. ”
As she turned and went to go put on her vest, I scooped up the last thing I was taking with me to the protest. It was a wide angle button cam attached to a support pack the size of a large cell phone. The support pack had a small solid state drive along with enough connectivity hardware to live stream whatever the cam filmed. It had a decent battery life, good for a few hours of live streaming that could be extended by plugging it into the same kind of external battery pack one might use to charge a phone on the go. I pinned the button cam to my heavy jacket and threaded the thin connector cable through the coat’s headphone slot. I dropped the support pack and extra battery in the coat’s inside pocket and checked myself in the mirror again.
The camera was completely unobtrusive and the heavy bulk of the warmly padded jacket hid the bulge of the support pack and battery perfectly. Once I turned it on, the rig would livestream the entire protest to a private website monitored by a few of my old friends. If anything went sideways, they’d make sure that unedited footage made its way into the public’s hands. It was a precaution that more than a few of us cynical types had started taking after the riots in 2020, a way to make sure that the unvarnished truth gets out when the media starts spinning events one way or another.
I was depressingly certain that before today was through it would turn out to have been a very good idea.

            <Title>Political Structure</Title>
            <Text>The Drakon Confederacy appears to outsiders to be a loose conglomerate of allied states each ruled by a singular Dragon-King. The reality is, however somewhat more complex. The Confederacy is a more unified government than is readily apparent to outsiders as each of the Dragon-Kings sits on the Council of Wyrms, a governing body nominally led by the eldest of the Dragon-Kings, called the High King or First King, who is a first among equals.
The Council is responsible for the social stratification of the Confederacy, establishes how Dragon-Kings are to treat those beneath them, and generally insures that conflicts between Dragon-Kings devolve into open violence only rarely. The Council also establishes the Anathema and the Compact. The Anathema is a set of laws that are so absolute that any trespass of them is grounds for immediate execution of the violator, regardless of standing. Should one of the Dragon-Kings commit Anathema all of the Council will descend on them en masse and destroy them. The Compact is the formal definition of the minimum rights and privileges of each of the social classes of the Confederacy, from the Royals to the Serfs, which is mandated across all of the states of the Confederacy. 
Within any given state of the Confederacy the general structure of the government is slightly more variable, save for one absolute, the Dragon-Kings are absolute monarchs whose word is law. Beneath them, each Dragon-King establishes some manner of bureaucracy headed up by the Mage families who have been granted varying degrees of nobility. The nobility tend to the day to day running of the state, as directed by the Dragon-King and the Compact. Some states within the Confederacy grant much greater rights and privileges to its people, others grant only what is mandated by the Compact. A few oppress and degrade their people to the absolute limit of what can be argued as permissible under the Compact. So long as there is no overt flouting of the Compact, the Council does not intervene.

            <Title>Scene 3</Title>
            <Text>Opening my eyes again after feeling a sniper round slam into my head was literally the last thing I ever expected to happen. The darkness that followed that split second of agony had felt cold and eternal. But based on the sight that confronted me, it had actually lasted only moments. 
I was lying on the cold pavement of the street where I’d been shot and could still hear the raucous clamor of the riot in progress. Only… there was no pain. Not from the shoulder that the first sniper round had destroyed or from any of the other myriad aches and pains I accumulated in a half century on this ball of mud. Even the sounds around me seemed muted and distant somehow. I blinked a few times staring up at the cold, gray autumn sky. 
“You okay there, Malcolm?” A soft, kindly, feminine voice spoke from somewhere nearby on my right. 
I turned my head and found a young woman, dressed all in black squatting down next to me. Her skin was pale as snow, her makeup decidedly goth in styling. And a large silver ankh necklace hung between her breasts atop her lacy shirt. I felt instantly as if I should know her and yet her identity escaped me.
“Uh… I think so?” My voice came out shaky. I sat up slowly, trying to process what was going on around me.
She rose to her feet with a fluid grace I would have had difficulty matching when I was her age, let alone at mine, before offering me a slender hand. “Let me help you up. That was a hard way to go.”
Her fingers were cool to the touch and, combined with her words, the contact sent gooseflesh racing up my arm and a chill down my spine. She was strong, not even straining to draw my more than 200 pounds onto my feet. Something just wasn’t adding up.
That’s when my eyes fell on the pavement where I’d been sitting. Where my body was still sitting in a pool of darkening blood, bone and grey matter. 
“Oh.” I recognized my voice as I said that simple syllable. It was a nothing word, only loaded with the entire weight of my world. 
“Yeah,” Death answered, her voice still soft and kind. She stepped up beside me and slid a comforting arm over my shoulders. “You did good. You died on your feet standing up for what you believed in. And you saved more lives than you’ll ever know,” she waved vaguely at the riot going on behind us that now seemed so far away. “The echoes of what you did here will ripple outward for a very long time.” 
Death smiled warmly at me, “You kept your oath. And you were one of the sparks that will light the fires that save the nation you loved. But your duty here is done. Now it’s time to talk about what comes next.”
As her words were sinking in, I turned toward the last group of cops that had confronted me before the sniper took me. Two of the officers were down and bleeding badly, the others working to try and staunch the wounds. “What comes next?” I echoed, still confounded by the end of my mortal life.
Death slipped her hand into mine and guided me away from the riot. “What comes next.” she affirmed with a nod.</Text>

            <Title>Scene 2</Title>
            <Text>The crowd of protesters moved with an almost stately pace down the packed city streets, but the tension continued to ratchet upwards. The sidewalks and storefronts were jammed with crowds who were being eyeballed by the city and state police that were lining the streets in full-on riot gear. Somewhere up ahead I could hear the loud and raucous shouting and chanting of the counter-protesters. They were spewing bigotry and white supremacist agitprop, calling for the arrest and deportation of anyone who dared question the ‘lawful’ authorities. 
The tension had my PTSD driven hyper-vigilance cranked up to an eleven, but I was managing to keep it contained so far. I kept sweeping the crowd with my eyes, watching for the spark that might set off the powder keg around us. My ears were almost useless amidst the noise of the crowd, but I did what I could to tune it out, listening for the sounds that shouldn’t be there. 
Midi and I were near the front of the crowd but out toward one edge, away from the center. It was another of her concessions to my paranoia that we were positioned such that we could get out of the crush of the crowd if things did go sideways. I’d take my odds of breaking past a police barricade over my odds of surviving a stampede on the off chance someone started shooting. 
Courtesy of our positioning, we were among the first to catch sight of the approaching counter protest, and it made my stomach drop to somewhere around my ankles. Military and paramilitary gear was abundantly present in the approaching group, along with uniformed police. These cops weren’t in riot gear and the variation in uniforms made it pretty clear that most were out-of-towners who felt that marching in support of their ‘brothers in blue’ was somehow appropriate. While the uniformed cops had sidearms and more than a few were carrying police batons, all of that was overshadowed by the dozens of civillians open-carrying assault rifles while sporting militia colors.
It wasn’t a counter protest. It was an armed mob. And it was coming straight down the road at us.
The adrenaline hammered my heart. I very casually moved my right hand near the pistol I had concealed earlier. This was about to turn into a stand off, and I had no doubt it was going to get ugly fast. I used my other hand to grab Midi and pull her close, close enough that I could put my mouth near her ear to be sure she heard me. 
“This is gonna turn violent. Fast. Grab anyone you can and bail. Fall back to my truck, the spare key is hidden in the usual spot. Get out of the downtown area before this turns into a full-blown riot.”
She’d gone pale before I ever started talking, but her spine stiffened at my words. “If I’m running what are you going to do?” The words were hard, almost accusatory.
“I swore an oath to protect this nation before you were even born Midi, I’m going to do my duty and protect whoever I can,” I answered, my own words sharper than I intended. “Now run!” 
She shot me an angry look but did what I told her to, grabbing the handful of her friends that were nearest us and corralling them away from the crowd and out of harm’s way before things could turn violent. I turned back to the brewing confrontation and tried to assess what I could do to buy time for them and anyone else with the good sense to see where this was going and bail out.
The counter-protest mob had spread out to completely block the street. They clearly weren’t going to let us finish our march to the capitol building where the press conference was scheduled. The shouts were getting louder, accusations hurled by both sides, with the obviously armed mob demanding that we disperse and go crawl back under our rocks. And the actual riot cops lining the sides of the streets did nothing. 
I just happened to be looking in the right direction when all hell finally broke loose. Someone in the thick of the counter protesters hurled a tear gas grenade at our group and chaos erupted. The armed thugs leading the counter protest immediately raised their weapons to firing positions and someone panicked, pulling that first, fateful trigger.
Within a few heartbeats the street turned into a war zone and I was back in Mogadishu. The air thickened fast with the acrid smell of discharged firearms and human waste. I didn’t remember drawing my pistol, but it was suddenly in my hands. I didn’t return fire though. It wasn’t time to fight back, it was time to protect those who couldn’t fight back. A quick glance around showed that there were a lot of college kids around me. Some were ducking and covering like pros, others had pissed themselves or worse as bullets whipped past them.
“Down!” I shouted at them, “Get low and run!” I suited words to action, demonstrating how to hunch over and move away from the incoming fire. “Don’t just stand there unless you want to die!”
They moved and we started to retreat just in time to find our way obstructed by the riot cops moving in on us behind their shields and swinging batons. At us. I heard the deeper barks of riot shotguns firing bean bags or baton rounds into the panicking, fleeing crowd.
Were they actively trying to turn this into a massacre? The idiots with assault rifles were still firing wildly into the crowd, tear gas grenades were popping off all over, and the city police force was impeding our ability to flee for our lives.
Just ahead of me I could see a white riot cop swinging his baton down with all his might at the unprotected head of one of the protesters, a dark skinned boy who’d stumbled over something on the street and was entirely off balance and falling already. There was no conscious thought in what I did next. Some responses are just too deeply ingrained and too automatic, even decades after the last time you needed them. My pistol came up, I dropped to one knee, aimed and squeezed the trigger. The six gram slug hit the officer at 1200 feet per second from a distance of less than a dozen feet. The unexpected impact against his vest staggered the officer, unbalancing him and sending him sprawling with the momentum of his own baton swing. It saved the kid from having his head smashed open like an over-ripe melon. 
I moved, shoving myself back to my feet and grabbing the kid before another of the cops could react. I yanked him back onto his feet and shouted, “Keep moving!” As soon as he was balanced and moving on his own, I pivoted back toward the cops and away from the crowd. I had shot one of them, and I seriously doubted that was going to go over well.
I wasn’t wrong. Even as I dropped toward a kneeling firing stance for a second time, I saw muzzle flare from no less than a half dozen standard issue sidearms. Given the typical accuracy of police gun fire, I wasn’t in immediate danger, and thankfully my cut to one side meant that there weren’t a lot of other people in the line of fire. Hopefully, I wasn’t about to get anyone killed.
I let my training take over again, four more trigger squeezes in quick succession and I’d shot four more officers squarely in their vests, hopefully straight into their trauma plates, since that’s what I was aiming for. If real life were like an action movie, I’d have sent all four crashing backwards to the ground. Unfortunately, three officers were braced in better shooting stances and didn’t go sprawling.
Still, getting shot, even through a vest, hurts like a motherfucker. It bought me some time to move before they fired at me again. I squeezed off two more rounds into the pavement at their feet, hoping that the chips of concrete and deflected slugs tearing across legs and lower bodies would buy me some additional distraction time. Then I whirled straight into the line of riot shields.
By this point the advancing officers had screwed up and spread their line as they failed to advance in unison. More proof that things were spiraling more chaotically then anybody expected. I slanted my path toward a gap in the line. The trailing officer saw what I was doing and tried to move to block my path, so I pulled my pistol in tight to my body and fired off a rapid group of shots into one side of his riot shield, jerking him slightly that direction with the impact. It gave me just enough room to dart through and behind the police line. Then I was running hell-bent for leather for a side street, knowing that at least some of the boys in blue would be coming after me. Which meant that many fewer busting heads on people who wanted nothing more than to peacefully protest obvious injustice.
The first sign of my luck turning bad came when something hit me, hard, in the back of my shoulder. I screamed as the round punched through the kevlar of my vest, shattered my shoulder blade and kept going. The impact and the pain sent me sprawling forward, ass over tea kettle. That could only have been one thing. A sniper round. The police had god damned snipers positioned around the protest route! My left shoulder was wrecked, I was bleeding and the pain was enough to make me want to lay there and die. Instead I struggled to my feet bracing myself up with my right hand, which was still holding tight to my pistol. 
I was having trouble breathing. Had the round put a hole in my lung? I staggered and turned to see half a dozen cops with guns ordering me to drop my weapon and get on the ground. I blinked slowly, trying to keep my balance and clear the pain from my head. That shot was going to leave me crippled, a fact I knew all too well. And after having shot several police officers, that was assuming I lived long enough to get treatment, which was doubtful in the midst of what had become a riot. Fuck it. Fifty years was longer than I thought I’d live when I was in my twenties. If killing me kept some of these fuckers from hurting anyone else, I’d take that as a win.
I raised my pistol and fired, no longer aiming for vests or riot shields. At least one of these fascist fucks was going to join me in death. Depend on it.
I never even heard the shot that killed me. One moment my life was crimson pain and noise and defiant anger. The next it was cold darkness.

            <Title>Scene 4</Title>
            <Text>To my complete amazement, a few minutes later I found myself sitting in a quiet cafe, across the table from Death, with a large hot chocolate in my hand. We weren’t anywhere I recognized, but serenity seemed to permeate the place.
“Where are we?” I blurted out. It was like my awareness snapped back into focus after dozing off briefly. I couldn’t even remember how we got here.
“Just a quiet place to talk,” she answered with a smile. “No one here will notice us and they make some of the best hot chocolate in this hemisphere.”
“I’m dead… what is there to talk about?” My confusion must have been evident on my face.
“Drink your chocolate and I’ll explain,” she gestured to my cup and smiled quietly at me, with her eyebrows raised until I complied.
She was right, it was the best hot chocolate I ever tasted. Fitting since it was probably going to be the last one I ever tasted.
“So,” her smile turned a little mischievous as she spoke, “you created a bit of a dilemma back there. You simultaneously earned admission to no less than three different afterlives. It would have been four if Athena had any say in it, but the Greek pantheon’s afterlife is…” Death waved her hand in a so-so gesture, “weird by modern standards.”
“Oh? How so?” I couldn’t help asking between sips of hot chocolate, shoving down the sheer insanity of discussing my potential afterlife with Death herself.
“They didn’t have anything like a unified concept of an afterlife—other than Hades’ realm—for centuries before they came up with the idea of the Elysian Fields. And even then the various sects never fully agreed on how one earned admission to the Fields.” Death sighed like this had been a thorn in her side for millennia, which it very well might have been.
“I can see how that might make it… complicated,” I agreed with a nod.
“But, as it stands, you’ve got a free pass to Valhalla, Tir na nOg, or Ersetu if you so choose,” she smiled and sipped her chocolate, a twinkle in her dark eyes. “Or, you could choose what’s behind door number 4.”
“Door number 4?” I felt completely overwhelmed at this point, baffled by the entire concept. “Wait, why do I get a choice for that matter?”
“You chose to revere deities from four—very different—pantheons and you walked a path that pleased every god and goddess you had faith in. Odin and the Morrigan came to blows over who was going to get your soul for their afterlife!” Death chuckled. 
I choked on my hot chocolate. Or, I should have. I definitely inhaled some of it in shock, but none of the reflexive coughing and choking actually happened. Which kind of makes sense, since I was dead and didn’t need to breathe.
“Oh.” I felt like I was saying this word too much, but suddenly getting a glimpse behind the curtain of the universe was a lot to take in. “So what usually happens with… people like me?”
“Normally, you’d go to the afterlife of whichever deity you considered the most important. But you didn’t actually consider one of them to be your chief deity, they were all equally important to you…”
“And that’s why I get a choice?” I asked.
“I knew you were a smart one,” Death confirmed with a smile.
“But why do I get a fourth choice? Shouldn’t I just be choosing between the three afterlives I earned?”
“Well, you are an odd case because you didn’t fail any of the main precepts of the gods you chose to believe in. You died on your feet, weapon in hand, fighting your enemy, which pleased Odin and the Morrigan to no end. You fought not for fame or glory, but to protect those deserving protection and you fought smart, making sure that you sowed seeds of victory even in defeat, which had Athena singing your praises. And when it was all on the line, you used every weapon you had and all the ferocity you could muster, which very much suited the draconic versions of Tiamat and Abzu that influenced your belief in them.” Her smile widened, “You had four times as many chances to fail or doom yourself, and still succeeded. You literally played with religion set on nightmare difficulty and won.”
“Oh.” Gods above, I swear I must sound like a moron, but how was I supposed to react to that?
“Which brings us again to door number 4. Across the entire cosmos, I rarely have to intervene to settle disputes among the various pantheons over who gets what souls for their various afterlives.” Death finished off her hot chocolate and smiled at me. “On those occasions when I do, I offer the most interesting mortals an option the local gods don’t have access to.”
“And what option is that?”
“Another chance. Another turn of the wheel,” Death replied, looking smug.
“Reincarnation?”
“Yes, but not here,” she nodded. “Some local religions already do that and to be frank, another life in this world isn’t exactly what a lot of people would think of as a reward. You’d be reborn in another world. In a universe with very different rules from this one.” 
“Would I remember any of this if I took that option? Wouldn’t that just be agreeing to cease to exist and become someone else?”
“No, you would still be you. Your memories of this world and this life will be…vague while you grow up in the other world. Ideas, impressions. Things that might well mold you into a person with the same values and moral compass.” Her smile turned sly. “Or maybe they won’t, maybe you’ll embrace entirely different parts of who you can be. However, it will be you under it all. And a time will come in that life where you’ll be given a choice: to remember Malcolm Cole’s life completely, including this conversation, or to let it all go forever.”
Wow.
It really was a second chance. An opportunity to experience an entirely different life in an entirely different world. Another life. I could make different choices. I could follow different paths. I could be something other than a tired cynic watching the world I grew up in burn to ashes around me…
“Okay.”
“Okay?” she asked still smiling slyly.
“Door number 4,” I answered with a sharp nod, before the darkness closed around me again.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>
