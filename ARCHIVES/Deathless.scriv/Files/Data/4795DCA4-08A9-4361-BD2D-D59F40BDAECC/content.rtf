The eldest son of a lower middle class family, his young life was hard, marked by walking the edge of poverty among the Appalachian mountains. Malcolm was an intelligent boy, who often used books to escape the hardships of being poor in the 1980\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. Like most children of Generation X, Malcolm grew up an almost feral child, raised on trauma, sarcasm and neglect. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Like many such young men, Malcolm fled into the Army seeking a better life then what his parents had. He served with distinction as a recon scout and sniper in several conflicts throughout his time in the regular army before being assigned to the Joint Special Operation Command and working with the US Intelligence Community. He left the service after an injury left him with chronic pain and weakness in one leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He spent his medical retirement working as a corporate security consultant before getting involved in social activism as he got older and American politics got increasingly conservative and repressive. }}
