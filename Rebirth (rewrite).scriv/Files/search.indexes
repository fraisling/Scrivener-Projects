            <Title>Bad Business</Title>
            <Text>Marcus indulged in a full and leisurely meal when he reached his hotel, spending more than hour just enjoying good food and the fact he wasn’t having to support weight on his aching feet and legs. And the food truly had been excellent, well worth both the time and money spent. While not completely refreshed, the relaxing meal had taken some of the edge off his pain, making it tolerable once again. He savored that feeling of a second wind, right up until Dennis Leary began singing ‘I’m an asshole’ from the phone in his pocket, making him want to toss it out the window. He only had one person who’d been set to that ring tone for his trip, and he was sure that he would not enjoy this phone call.
Fishing out his phone, he injected forced cheerfulness into his deep baritone, “Craig, this better be an actual, honest to god emergency or I’m going to key your Porsche when I get back.”
“Damn it, Marcus, that’s not funny! When were you going to tell me that Jimmy offered to buy you out? I thought we were in this together?” 
“We were. Actually still are since I haven’t made a decision yet one way or the other,” he answered, “but if you try to say you’re surprised I’m considering it then you’ve been lying to yourself. You know damn well that my heart hasn’t been in it for a while now.”
“I thought that was the point of this whole vacation thing?” Craig countered, “You spend a week in Vegas followed by a week on a Cruise ship, you clear your head and get back in the game.”
“Or I spend those two weeks clearing my head and decide that what’s best for the business is selling my half to Jimmy and riding off into the sunset,” Marcus shot back. “Either way it’s win-win for you cause you’ll either get a motivated partner back in two weeks, or a partner who’s transitioning out to let someone who cares take over.”
“Oh, stow that bullshit. You know Jimmy’s dead weight when it comes to dealing with clients. On his best days he’s half the closer you are on your worst days.”
“Then find somebody else to offer me more than Jimmy did,” he retorted. “I’m tired, Craig. The world is turning to shit around us and I’m just done pretending to care about things that have stopped mattering to me. I’ll send you a copy of Jimmy’s offer, but if you or someone else doesn’t make a better offer than it than I’m making no promises. Just be glad I’m not entertaining offers from actual outsiders. But, if you call me again before I get back, I’ll accept Jimmy’s offer on the spot and you can fucking deal with it. I’m done talking about this.”
Marcus hung up the phone and struggled for a brief moment with the urge to fling it down on the hotel concourse and stomp on it. He breathed deeply, focusing on letting go of his frustration. Once upon a time, he and Craig had been equally and enthusiastically invested in the security consulting group they’d set up, but they’d ultimately had different standards for what constituted success. Craig had always wanted more: more money, more clients, more renown. Marcus, on the other hand, had wanted a life. He wanted enough money to live well, but didn’t need to live extravagantly. He didn’t need a Porsche and a McMansion, didn’t need the newest latest best in everything, didn’t need bespoke suits and a millionaire life. 
Of course, Craig’s marriage had ended in divorce specifically because he wasn’t providing those things to his wife, so maybe Marcus could understand some of the drive. Since the divorce, however, Craig had been impossible. The job had become his entire life, and he spent way too much time listening to podcasts and streams from big shot tech-bros and venture capitalist types who didn’t believe in work-life balance. Suddenly his business partner thought they both needed to put in 12 hour days 6 days a week to turn their enterprise into something “real.” Marcus thought that was overkill. Even if he wanted to, there was no way their security consulting group was ever going to be a Fortune 500 company like Google or Amazon. It just wasn’t realistic.
Letting out a final deep breath that totally wasn’t a sigh, Marcus made up his mind. If Craig wanted to take a small, regional company like theirs and make them some giant national or even multinational concern, he could do it without Marcus. He turned back to his phone, typed up a quick email, attached a copy of the offer Jimmy had made for his interest in the group. 
He sent the email, put the phone in his outer cargo shorts pocket, and felt a weight lift off his chest, felt himself melt back into a calm state of mind. It was past time he put himself and his family first. Craig could figure his own shit out.</Text>

The warning notification appeared the moment he exited the hallway and was confronted with four System lock-boxes and a pedestal holding a massive tome. He quickly identified the lock-boxes, finding two Uncommon Tutorial Dungeon Chest, one Epic Tutorial Dungeon Chest, and one Legendary Tutorial Dungeon Chest. When he turned his Identify to the book, the skill simply failed to activate, startling him.  
He stepped up to pedestal and studied it more closely. The cover was metal and engraved with smaller versions of the dragons that had been on the doors to the dungeon and to the sphinxes chamber. Reaching out carefully, he touched the cover and was immediately confronted with a System notification.

Do you wish to accept this Profession?

Marcus had to read the message three times for the details to really sink in. He was being offered a Legendary Profession. One that seemed to combine something akin to an old school pulp adventurer with an alchemist and an artificer and then sprinkle a bunch of skills and stat points on top. What Gen X kid hadn’t grown up wanting to be Indiana Jones?
“Yes,” he answered immediately. Instantly the book vanished, having been consumed to grant him the Profession.  

Congratulations! Pathfinding (Profession) (Tier 1) has merged with Tracking (General) (Tier 1) to become Improved Pathfinding (Profession)(Tier 2)!
Hidden Objective Completed: Complete the Secrets of the Past and claim its legacy (2/2)! 5000 IP awarded for unique objective.

The warm rush of increasing stats was quickly replaced by the spiking pain in his skull that resulted from learning so many skills all at once. This time was even worse than when he’d taken the Magus Class, driving him to his knees and leaving him clutching his head in pain. After what felt like an eternity of agony, the pain receded, leaving him panting in relief. He pushed himself heavily to his feet and focused on the next task at hand: loot.
 After a moment’s consideration, Marcus moved to the two Uncommon chests first, choosing to save the, ostensibly, best treasure for last. The first box contained a rune-encrusted cauldron, and the second a leather roll that contained a variety of tools.

Uncommon Alchemist’s Travel Cauldron (Tier 1) - a travel sized cauldron for the Alchemist on the go. Enchanted to allow the Alchemist finer control over the mana within the cauldron as well as to permit the Alchemist to precisely control the heat levels within it without need for external flames. Self repairs within certain limits.
Requirements: Level 1 in a compatible Profession. 

Uncommon Arcanist’s Tools (Tier 1) - a set of high quality tools for the adventuring Arcanist. Includes tools for tinkering, engraving, disabling traps and open mechanical locks as well as performing minor repairs on a variety of different types of equipment.  Enchanted to be exceptionally durable and to self repair within certain limits.
Requirements: Level 1 in a compatible Profession or Skill.

They made a good start for his loot session, with both items having great potential for usefulness with his new Profession. Then he turned to the much smaller epic and legendary chests, each of which looked more like fancy jewelery boxes than actual chests.  He flipped open the first box to find what looked like a slightly over-sized, octagonal casino chip made of what looked like a faintly glowing blue crystal. He immediately identified it. 

Epic Upgrade Token (Tier 3) - a special, one-time use item containing the necessary mana and karma to upgrade any item of less than Epic (Tier 3)  quality to Epic (Tier 3). 
Requirements: Upgraded item will require Tier 3 to use.

Now that was pure gold right there. The ability to upgrade any item instead of needing to replace it. Sure it was useless right now, but as long as he lived to reach Tier 3, that was going to incredibly useful. He set the token aside with the other gear he still needed to stow before opening the legendary box.  Inside the final box was nestled a heavy silver thumb ring, set with a beautifully cut, amber colored gem.  

Legendary Arcanist’s Secret Archive (Tier 1) - Arcanist’s are renowned for two things: their pursuit of knowledge and their ability to keep secrets. Grants +5 Intelligence and +5 Wisdom when bound. Gives the wearer access to an extradimensional storage space of moderate size. The storage space holds all items placed within in stasis, keeping them in exactly the same state as they were when stored. Living, non-sentient plants and fungi may be stored within without damage or deterioration. Clothing and equipment may equipped to your body directly from storage or placed from your body directly into storage. Allows the Arcanist to place texts within and retrieve texts from the Hidden Archive, a legendary secret repository of knowledge long thought lost. This is a growth item, containing a vast potential. It may be readily upgraded to advance in Tier alongside the Arcanist to whom it is soul-bound.  
Requirements: Arcanist level 1, Soul-bound

He stared slack jawed at the item description. Clearly the System didn’t slack off when it came to Legendary items. He quickly slipped it onto his right hand. As his torc had done before, he felt the ring begin to pull on his mana and absorb it. Only, instead of draining just a few points of mana, it sucked down fully half of his mana pool in a few short moments before stopping. Then he felt something change as the ring became an actual part of him, integrating itself into the very shape of his soul. It was an uncomfortable sensation, like a carefully stretching a muscle he hadn’t consciously used before. 
The moment the ring bound itself to his soul, Marcus became intimately aware of the how to store and retrieve items within it, how to use the Hidden Archive, and of the exact size, shape and contents of the ring’s storage space. With a wave of his hand his new cauldron, toolkit, and token vanished into the rings storage. A second wave moved the contents of his sling bag into the storage, along with his bedroll. A third gesture stowed the potions he had stored on his belt. He couldn’t help but laugh in absolute delight. A flick of his wrist and a thought had his research journal appear in his hand. Another thought and it was back in the sling bag in his storage space.

Dungeon will end in 1:38:50

Grinning widely, Marcus headed back through the hallway and back into the Dungeon. He proceeded past the final test room and down the second hallway into the Research Library he had used to help solve the fourth test. He paused for a moment, considering the bookshelves, only to realize that every book in the Dungeon was already present in the Hidden Archive.  He detoured into the small sleeping chamber he had used while he worked on the Mana disruptor, swiping the narrow bed, complete with bedding, into his storage. Then he headed into the lab and swiped the contents of every shelf full of ingredients and reagents into his storage. He took the living plants, mosses and fungi as well and even swiped the cabinets full of potion vials into his storage space, along with a full set of the alchemical tools. After all it wasn’t as if anyone else would need it after he left.
Once he was satisfied that he’d taken everything he had access to that might be the slightest bit useful, Marcus headed back to the final room of the Dungeon. Without the presence of loot to occupy his attention he saw the other thing the room contained, a large, plain, metal door that seemed entirely out of place. Presuming it to be his way out, he immediately approached, laying his hand on the bare metal.

            <Title>Planning and Interruptions</Title>
            <Text>“We a need a plan,” Marcus cut in, dropping his hands from his face. “At least a general one, since we won’t really know what we’re in for until the main event starts. It would be good to all be on the same page in case we’re immediately dropped into a fight or something.”
The girls and Roberto immediately grew serious and turned to him. “Good idea,” Freya nodded. “Seeing as we’ve put together a fairly standard 5 man group, I’m assuming some or all of us were gamers?”
Everyone nodded in response. “Well then, that makes this a bit easier. If a fight breaks out, I’ve got an ability that should draw aggro to me. I’ll defend myself the best I can and keep them from going after the rest of you as much as I can. Roberto, you focus on keeping me alive and heal anybody else who gets hit as you can. Cassie, India, and Marcus give me a ten-count before you start burning them down.”
Marcus nodded, “If we get a single opponent that should be fine. If things get more… complicated then Cassie play defense. Try to keep one busy but focus on not getting yourself hurt, just keep it off Roberto. India, you’re a… Sniper?” There was the barest hesitation before he said the word sniper. “I don’t see a weapon though?”
“I know,” she said with a wicked smirk. Then she reached over her shoulder, and as her hand touched it, what looked like a long barreled Flintlock rifle appeared suddenly, slung across her back. “It’s one of my abilities. Weapons I carry but am not actively using go out of phase with reality and become invisible until I touch them.”
Roberto gawked at her. “Damn hermana, that is pretty bad ass.”
“I’m assuming you’ve got some stealth or camoflage abilities too then?” Marcus followed up hopefully.
“Definitely,” she replied still smirking.
Marcus nodded, “Then when a fight breaks out, or beforehand if we get a chance to prepare, I want you hidden and ready. I expect you’ll be our best alpha striker, most range and highest damage. So take your time and take that perfect shot for maximum effect.” He grinned, “One shot, one kill would be ideal but if not, make it count anyway. And stay out of sight. What they can’t find they can’t hit.”
She nodded, her face turning serious. “I’ve never done any real life shooting, so an opportunity to take a few before we end up in a real fight wouldn’t be a bad thing. I mean, the skills I got for using guns mean I know how, but…” she trailed off with a shrug.
“Hopefully we’ll be able to give you that chance,” Marcus agreed. “I mean we all had a bunch of new things shoved into our heads and hopefully that included the muscle memory to go with all these new abilities but it would be good to actually practice a little with them before our lives are on the line.”
“I should be good,” Cassie interjected. “I’ve been doing fencing and swordplay with a local HEMA club and I was probably one of the three or four best swordsmen in Vegas with a light blade before the System jammed even more knowledge and skill into my head.”
“HEMA?” Roberto asked.
“Historical European Martial Arts,” Cassie and Freya said in unison before smiling widely.
“I thought I recognized your name,” Freya told Cassie with a grin. “I’m in one of the other HEMA clubs, but I focused on axe and shield, so lucky me for becoming a dwarf.”
Marcus frowned a bit in thought before Roberto spoke again, “India and I just did a lot of tabletop and online RPG’s, so no real-world skills for us I’m afraid.” He glanced at Marcus. “How about you dragon-man? You got real-world skill or just a gamer like us?”
“Both,” Marcus replied absently. “Ex-military, spent a couple years in the SCA and I’ve probably been a gamer longer than any of you have been alive… Do you think that’s what caused us to evolve different races? I mean, the same thing in us that drew us to RPG’s and historical stuff.”
India nodded thoughtfully, “Maybe? I mean, the System said it ‘activated dormant traits in my pattern,’ whatever that means. But maybe those traits weren’t completely dormant before and drew us all to various kinds of fantasy games and similar things? A longing for a world where those traits would be active?”
“It’s not a bad theory,” Freya agreed. “But the sample set’s way too small to know for sure, even if we asked every non-human here. We all ended up in this kind of tutorial for choices we made, which means we’re not a proper representative sample.”
“Does it really matter either way?” Cassie offered. “I mean I get the urge to try and understand the how and why of this weird-ass new world we’ve been dropped in, but…” She shrugged. “It doesn’t change the immediate situation at any rate.”
“No, you’re right,” Marcus shook his head like he was dislodging the thought. “We need to focus on the situation at hand. So, if we don’t immediately wind up ass-deep in alligators, I think our first priority needs to be to focus on survival. Shelter, food, and water, someplace safe to rest before nightfall.”
India nodded. “Once we have some kind of safe camp, we can start hunting points. Water is going to be the big thing, we can miss a couple meals without any real harm, but dehydration isn’t something to fuck with.”
Everyone nodded and Cassie spoke up, “Sounds like we have a good plan, then.”
She was about to continue when Marcus stiffened up, distracting her and causing her to trail off. “What is it,” she suddenly whispered, seeing Marcus’s eyes fixed on something behind her.
“Incoming, group of six or so tough guys coming our way,” he replied sotto voce. “Looks like trouble.”
Their group turned to face the approaching band of men. They walked with the kind of swagger common to guys who were used to bullying people and getting their way. The kind who not only didn’t mind to bust a few heads to make a point, but actually actively enjoyed it. They were all big, barrel-chested sorts and looked like a stereotypical gang of bikers or street thugs gone medieval with chain armor and various weapons.
The one Marcus presumed to be the leader was the biggest of the six, towered over them at maybe 2 full meters tall and looked like he belonged in a professional wrestling ring. Unlike the others, he wore rugged hide bracers and spaulders, but his upper body was mostly bare and heavily muscled. He had a massive, two-handed great axe gripped casually just beneath the head in one plate sized hand. Marcus definitely didn’t like the malicious glint in his eyes.
When they were maybe two or three paces away, the thugs stopped and spread out in loose line, the leader in the center of the line and maybe half-a-pace closer. Marcus’s group had responded to their approach by forming up with him in the center, flanked by Freya and Cassie who stood maybe a half-step to the side and behind him on the left and right respectively. He could practically feel Roberto and India a couple steps further behind him.
The leader eyed Marcus off, with a disdainful smirk. “You three ladies will be joining us,” he said flatly. “You two losers can fuck off.”
“Like hell we will,” Freya spat before Marcus could speak.
“We’ve already formed a group,” Marcus cut in before Freya could continue. “I think you should go hassle someone else.”
“I don’t recall asking your opinion, freaks,” the man replied, his smirk widening. He moved his arm sharply, his great axe jabbing out toward Marcus as he shifted his grip toward the end of the haft.  “You can do as I say, or we’ll throw you a beating and then you’ll do as I say, but you’ll be keeping your mouths shut and obeying either way.”
Marcus didn’t flinch at the move, but narrowed his eyes slightly. He activated his mana barrier to form an invisible wall between them just a few inches ahead of where Marcus and his team stood. He sensed more than felt India move carefully behind him. Hopefully readying her weapon where they couldn’t easily see her. “I don’t think so.” Marcus answered flatly. “Walk away, boy, before you fuck around and find out.”
“Okay, beat down it is,” the man said with a grin before he moved forward explosively, leading with his axe. The weapon hit the barrier and stopped like it had struck a wall, causing it flash blue at the impact point. The abrupt interruption of his movement caused the man to stumble and drop to one knee, almost losing his grip on the axe. “What the fuck?”
Marcus winced slightly at the sudden drain on his mana as the barrier pulled from his mana pool to stop his atta&quot;cker. Behind him, he felt India dive to one side, rolling up into and a kneeling firing position and leveling her rifle at the man. She fired without hesitation, as if it was as natural and instinctive a move as it looked. Rather than the thunderous sound of a flintlock discharge there was a only a loud crack and an intense discharge of mana as a projectile ripped through the air. It went through the mana barrier without being affected by it in the least. Marcus watched in fascination as the man’s left eye ruptured and the center of the back of his head exploded outward in a spray of gore.

The message, which Marcus assumed his entire group had received, settled the man’s fate quite decisively, prompting Marcus to speak before anyone else could react. “Last chance,” his voice was colder than arctic winter, without remorse or hesitation.  “Walk away and live, or join your comrade. Your choice.” 
Everyone stood frozen for a long moment, completely motionless, barely daring to breathe. Marcus was sure the entire room’s attention was focused on them now.
“Okay,” one of the other men raised his hands placatingly and stepped back, the others following suit within a moment or two. “You win this one, freak. But don’t imagine this is over, cause it ain’t.”
“As for the rest of you,” Marcus raised his voice like a drill instructor on the practice field so it carried through the whole room. “This isn’t the world we’re used to anymore. The rules have changed. If you don’t start shit with us, there won’t be shit, but if you start shit, we will finish it. Permanently. Understand?” 
He calmly moved his gaze over the motley assemblage, seeing looks of disgust and horror at what they had done mixed with nods of approval and understanding. For many, the dog eat dog nature of their new lives were just starting to sink in. As soon as Marcus was certain that their was no misguided attempt at retribution or at rallying the crowd to punish them for daring kill a human being, he turned his gaze to India. She was frozen in her firing position, her weapon fixed on the thug who had spoken as he backed away.
Dropping his voice low enough to avoid being overheard by anyone outside the group, “Freya, Cassie, stay near the barrier and keep your eyes open. Roberto, hang tight and back them if needed. I’m going to take India aside and lend her a hand.”
“On it, compa,” he said taking a step closer to the girls as Marcus moved toward India. 
India hadn’t yet moved or lowered her weapon. Marcus threw a quick glance over his shoulder and saw Cassie had her hand on the hilt of her rapier, ready to draw and Freya had their shield on one arm, axe hefted for a fight in the other.  
He approached India calmly, before crouching beside her and looking at her. “It’s okay,” he whispered. “You did great. That guy was planning to make you, Cassie and Freya little more than slaves. You stopped him and made sure he wasn’t going to be able to ever try something like that again.”
She swallowed, hard. “I didn’t even think,” she whispered back. “The reflexes were there, waiting. He made an aggressive move and I just reacted. And now he’s dead.”
“And you aren’t. And our team isn’t.” Marcus added. “If we had to fight them hand to hand? They could have gotten lucky and killed some of us. They definitely would have managed to hurt some of us and some more of them would have ended up dead before it was done. You achieved the best outcome with the least pain and misery by putting the leader down like that.”
“I’ve never even been in a real fight before,” she whispered. “I’ve never fired a weapon, let alone with intent. And my first time is to kill a man…”
He nodded. “Killing humans is never a simple thing, but it can be frighteningly easy. And as much as I wish I could say otherwise, I doubt this will be the last time you have to make that choice.” He kept his voice calm and even. There was no judgment in it, only compassion. “I remember my first time having to kill like that. I was in Somalia, attached to a Special Forces A-team, most junior weapons sergeant on the team. Like you, I was a sniper.” He shook his head slightly, “We were there to eliminate an arms dealer who selling to one of the Somali Warlords during their civil war. The hope was if we could cut down on the incoming support, we could de-escalate the conflict. I got the shot, team leader made the call and I put a bullet through a man’s head from 850 meters away. He never knew I was there or what killed him. I still see the look on his face when the bullet hit when I close my eyes sometimes.”
“Does it get easier?” she asked quietly. 
“Sadly, yes, it does,” he answered. “Or at least it did for me. After the first few, I stopped questioning it and just did what needed doing. The nightmares got fewer and farther between. They never completely went away though and sometimes I still wonder if I just don’t value human life the way others do.”
She nodded, finally lowering the weapon as the thugs turned their backs and picked up the pace of their retreat. Marcus stood slowly beside her, leaning on his staff to make it easier before he offered India his hand. She glanced at it for a moment before she took it, letting him help her to feet smoothly.
“When you start doubting, or worrying about whether or not you did the right thing,” Marcus still kept his voice low, for her ears only, “then just remember, some monsters need to be removed to protect those who can’t protect themselves. This guy was one of those monsters and he wouldn’t have lost sleep over killing any of us.”
She nodded again. Looking Marcus in the eyes, “Thanks… I don’t know which is worse knowing that I pulled the trigger and ended him, or the fact that I’m not feeling as bad about it as I think I should be…”
“It’s a whole new, lawless, world,” he replied, voice just loud enough for the whole team to hear him. “The only people we can count on to protect us, are us. Our team against whatever, or whoever, comes to hurt us. So I’m thankful that I have you on our team, India. I’m thankful for all four of you, and I trust you all to make the right decisions. And, yes, sometimes, that’s going to mean using lethal force against other humans or humanoids.” 
“You aren’t fucking wrong about that, compra,” Roberto added his thoughts. “This culero thought he was going to be the king of hill and was ready to start walking over us to get there. You did good, hermana. Real good.”
“You are one bad ass bitch,” Freya agreed, shooting India a wink. “I’m glad you’re on our side.”
India seemed to relax more seeing the lack of condemnation from her new friends. “Thanks,” she said with an only slightly forced smile.
“Definitely glad I talked to you,” Cassie agreed. “That was… just wow. Remind me to never, ever piss you off,” she shot India a teasing smile. “You wanna drop this barrier, daddy? I want to grab that axe for Freya before someone else gets brave and comes for it.”
Marcus rolled his eyes exaggeratedly and dismissed the barrier with a wave of his hand, “Not a bad idea. A spare, heavy weapon for our warrior could be helpful.”
The team relaxed as Cassie stepped forward and picked it up, wiping the handle on the dead man’s pants since it was spattered with blood. Then she turned to Freya and handed her the weapon, who took a good look at it, before curling her lip in distaste and tossing it back on the ground.
“No thanks,” she said with a slight shudder. “It’s cursed, or at least, I think it’s a curse. Using it makes it harder to control your temper and makes you stronger when you let you temper control you.” 
“Must be a berserker thing?” Roberto offered.
“Probably,” Marcus agreed.

            <Title>Tutorial Interlude 1</Title>
            <Text>Cassie cursed under her breath as she dodged aside from the charging boar, slashing it with her rapier as she half-stumbled out of its path, taking a gash on her hip as the beast’s tusks grazed her. Her blade seared a line of angry-looking magical burns into the creature as it parted flesh in a shallow slice. She turned her stumbling fall into a shoulder roll that brought her back to her feet. 
“Take this ya fuckin’ over-sized pork chop!” Cassie heard her Dwarven teammate, a warrior-type named Freya, bellow behind her. The shout was punctuated by the heavy thunk of an axe digging into flesh, with the boar squealing in pain.
“Freya! Go left!” Another woman’s voice ordered, followed by the loud crack of a rifle being fired an instant later. The other woman was India, her team’s only ranged attacker, a full on Sniper.
The boar’s squeals cut off abruptly. It crashed to the ground with sufficient force to imitate a small, localized earthquake. Cassie turned back to her team, pressing her free hand to her hip to staunch the bleeding. India’s shot had taken the boar straight through one eye, killing it instantly. 
“Cassie!” The single male voice in her team sounded alarmed as he approached. “Damn, hermana, you have to be more careful. That damn thing could have gutted you like a fish.” Roberto, an Elf with decidedly Hispanic features, moved quickly to her side, invoking a healing ability on her wound. 
“Just a scratch,” she waved off the concern.  “That was a bad-ass shot, India. Good job. Everybody else okay? I know I was not ready to be ambushed by Bebop’s under-mutated, ‘roid-raging cousin.”
“All good here, boss,” Freya called back, grunting as she removed her axe from where it had been left in the boar’s shoulder.
“Who the fuck is Bebop?” Roberto blurted out, sounding puzzled.
India appeared from her hiding place in the bushes. The rabbit-kin girl was tall, even with her ears laid back tensely. “I’m okay. I went to ground before it noticed me. Think it was alone?”
Cassie sheathed her blade as she answered. “I think so. As aggressive as that fucker was, I think if there were more nearby they’d already have attacked us.” Cassie, a fox-like Kitsune herself, flicked her tail back and forth forcefully to dislodge a smattering of leaf-litter from her fur. “Since Roberto has already fixed me, I can go up a tree and see if there’s anything else around in a bit.” 
“I think we can use some of this vine over here to haul the carcass up so we can dress and butcher it for food.” Freya offered, cleaning the edge of her axe as she stared at the corpse. “It’d be a shame to waste it and gods know I’m hungry. We can’t all live on berries and greens like our Lepori Sniper after all.”
Cassie hid a smirk as India flipped Freya an extended middle finger. “Not my fault you’re carnivores.” India shot back.
“Omnivores,” Roberto corrected, “not carnivores. In fact, I’m pretty sure Elves like me lean more toward the herbivorous side of omnivore than carnivore. And are you all just going to ignore my question? Who the fuck is Bebop?”
“Well, I definitely lean to the carnivorous side of omnivore, so I’m going to blame it on being Kitsune,” Cassie sniffed, feigning disdain. “I need more in my diet than leaves and berries.”
“Yeah, I’m a little tired of eating the food my food eats,” Freya agreed with a quick wink at Cassie. 
“Savages,” India shook her head in mock sadness. “I’m surrounded by savages.”
“You all certainly have the manners of a bunch of savages. Hello? Is anyone actually going to answer my question?” Roberto tried to interject.
Cassie snickered and moved to the base of one of the wider trees. “India, Roberto, keep watch. Freya, if you know how to field dress and butcher animals, go for it, I’ll help after I go up and have a look around if you need me.”
“First time in my life that all that time I spent in the SCA has actually been useful survival skills,” Freya muttered as she tested the strength of the vines before deciding to weave a few into a braided rope to hoist the dead boar.
“So, yeah, being ignored, got it.” Roberto griped as he walked a few paces away from the tree to look out for anything else coming their way.
“It’s not my fault your taste in classic animation is lacking,” Cassie called back to him as she flexed her claw tipped fingers and toes before scrambling up the side of the tree. “Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family!” She called down, then grinned at a memory. “Make a note of this: dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow!” 
“My… cow?” Roberto pinched his own arm, dramatically. “Nope, this is not some bizarre dream. I actually am taking orders from a nerdy fox-girl who watched way too many cartoons and my life has become some ridiculous fantasy roleplaying game. I’m surrounded by sexy, scary women who could kill me without missing a beat, and my efforts to be a gentleman are going completely unnoticed.”
“Wait, sexy scary women?” India cut in, clearly amused, “have you gone and turned furry on me?”
Cassie giggled the whole way up the tree at his exaggerated melodramatic sigh. She’d been lucky in having entered the Tutorial near a group of folks she knew. She and Freya were both heavily involved in the local Historical European Martial Arts clubs and SCA, while India and Roberto had been members of her tabletop gaming group. Somehow, all four of them had experienced what the System termed ‘unexpected racial evolution’ as part of being awakened to mana.  More interestingly, they all also had gotten uncommon or rare classes, which left her wondering if the personality traits that had drawn them to historical re-enactment and roleplaying games were the same traits that triggered those evolutions. 
She froze mid-thought as the scent of metal and mana made her nose twitch. She quietly sniffed the air, drawing in more of the scent and searching it for other living things. After a long minute of consideration, she decided there was nothing else there,  just the scents of the tree, and of a mana-rich metallic object. She shook her head and shifted her path up the tree toward the large branch the smell was emanating from. On the branch she found a large bird’s nest with a small treasure box inside it. 
Cassie spent a long moment scanning her surroundings for any sign of the nest’s owner. Finally deciding that she was alone, she reached in and snagged the box, shoving it in the satchel that hung from her belt before continuing up the tree. She halted just below the canopy and slowly circled the trunk, taking advantage of the higher line of sight to look for either potential trouble or other people. She caught sight of a raised hillock in the distance that looked like it might make a decent spot to set up a camp and cook the boar. The smoke would likely attract attention from anything living nearby, but that couldn’t exactly be helped. They didn’t need to eat as often or as much as they had before Mana adaptation, but being hungry sucked, and she wanted her group to avoid it as much as possible.
Thankfully there was no sign of anything dangerous between them and the hill, so she climbed back down quickly.
“Good news, boy and girls,” she declared as she dropped the last few feet to the ground. “I didn’t see anything dangerous close by, and I found a spot where we can build a fire and cook this pig without risking setting the forest aflame. There’s a big hill in a clearing maybe 2 kilometers or so from here.”
Freya grimaced at the news, “This is gonna be awkward as fuck to haul that far, it’ll take two of us to transport it.” She grunted, tossing the coil of vine she’d woven over a branch some eight or ten meters above the ground. She’d already secured one end of the makeshift rope around the rear hooves of the boar. “Cass, fix up a way for me to tie this off once I’ve got the boar off the ground. We need to bleed it and clean it before we carry it off. It’ll reduce the weight and keep it from stinking so much, so long as we don’t puncture the guts.”
“On it,” the Kitsune replied with a grin. “Roberto, catch.” She tossed him the treasure box she’d found. “Your turn, hope it’s something useful for you.” 
Roberto caught the tossed box and opened it with a small frown to discover a ring. After taking a moment to identify it, he shot a smile at Cassie. “Hell yes! A ring with bonuses to Wisdom, Willpower and Mana regeneration. That should help make keeping you all alive a little less taxing.”
She’d seen the 200 IP that made her part of the split for finding the treasure and knew that meant it was probably an Uncommon item, which was pretty good. When they’d found the Uncommon belt Freya had gotten yesterday, it had awarded the same 200 IP to each of them. “Good, now lend Freya a hand, that boar is probably heavier than she is and one branch does not a pulley make.”
Cassie, meanwhile, had fished a small hatchet off the back of her belt to cut a low branch from a small tree. Cassie split the branch into a Y shape, and drove the long, sharpened end that made up the bottom of the Y into ground at an angle. She gave Freya a thumbs-up. “Okay, tie off is ready when you are.”
Cassie then joined Freya and Roberto in adding her weight to Freya’s vine-rope, lifting the boar’s carcass. Together they pulled, hand-over-hand, hoisting the dead animal off the ground. Once its snout was a dangling a good 10 centimeters or so from the ground, Freya, who’d anchored the pull with her stockier body, tied the rope off and had the others gently, gradually let go of the vine. Seeing that both the stake and the makeshift rope held, doing their jobs properly, Freya smiled widely. “Well done. Now for the gross part.”
“I’ll cut us a pole to make carrying the carcass off easier,” Cassie suggested. “We can tie up the hooves, slide the poll between them, and let the carcass dangle underneath.”
“Good idea,” Freya agreed. “You and Roberto are of a height with each other, so with each of you shouldering an end of it, we should be fine. That’ll leave me and India freed up in case something gets uppity between here and that clearing you saw.”
“Are you calling me short or Cassie tall?” Roberto asked with a frown. 
“You’re all shorter than me,” India answered from the other side of the tree. “Does it really matter which it is?”
Freya meanwhile started on prepping the boar. Using a long knife she’d received in her starter gear, she opened the carcass up and went to work, letting gravity do most of the work for her. 
Within a half hour, with the well-cleaned carcass on a pole between Cassie and Roberto, they all trouped toward the hill Cassie had seen.

            <Title>Introduction's End</Title>
            <Text>Class: Magus (Uncommon) has reached Tier 1! Automatic stat points allocated.
Skill Learned: Mana Weapons (Tier 1)!
Skill Learned: Magical Theory (Tier 1)!
Skill Learned: Mana Control (Tier 1)!
Skill Learned: Mana Bolt (Tier 1)!
Skill Learned: Mana Barrier (Tier 1)!
Skill Learned: Meditation (Tier 1)!

Warmth spread through him once more as his Class reached tier 1 and his stats and resources were increased. 
Then the warmth transformed into a red-hot spike of pain that lasted several, eternal-seeming moments as the knowledge of his new Class skills were shoved into his head. He staggered slightly as the process continued, almost dropping to his knees before the pain abated. 
Damn, it was weird suddenly knowing things he didn’t remember learning. He attempted to shake the oddness off as his logical side reminded him that time was rapidly running out for the introduction.
Gasping, he glanced to his Guide. “Anything else I need to do before the Introduction ends?”
“It is recommended that you pick up the equipment provided for your chosen Class as you will be at quite a disadvantage without it,” she admonished, gesturing to the table full of gear that he hadn’t yet noticed. “Only 15 minutes remain in the Introductory period.”
On the table sat a neatly folded pile of what looked like tan linen cloth, a leather sling bag with a tightly rolled bedroll fastened to the bottom, another folded pile of much higher quality, dark green cloth, a leather belt with a series of loops for holding a dozen round objects with a diameter slightly larger than a standard shotgun shell on one side and a knife sheath on the other, a dozen vials of colored liquid that looked just the right size to fit the loops on the belt, a pair of leather bound books with a quill-like pen, a sharp, sturdy looking knife, and a final neatly folded pile of much heavier looking brown cloth that seemed to have an odd sheen to it. 
He stepped up to the table and recognized the first pile of cloth as clothing, which abruptly reminded him that he was still completely naked. Turning his back to the guide, he dressed as quickly as he could. The outfit consisted of a pair of drawstring pants, a comfortable half-sleeved linen tunic, a pair of boxers made of what looked and felt like raw silk, and a pair of thin-soled leather sandals. 
Next, he ignored the sling bag for a moment and examined the second pile of cloth, which turned out to be a sleeveless over-tunic similar to a surcoat. He quickly pulled it over his head and shrugged his arms through the holes for them. The over-tunic had laces on both sides beneath his arms which tightened on their own once the garment was settled into place. Beneath the laces, the front and back edges of the garments reached just above his knee. He wrapped the belt around himself and fastened it so that rode just across his hips without drooping further down, with the loops on his right side and the sheath on his left hip. He began scooping up the vials and settling them into the loops on his belt, pausing only long enough to invoke his identify skill on one of each color.

Inferior Health Potion (Tier 1) - this bright red liquid will restore lost vitality instantly when consumed.
Inferior Mana Potion (Tier 1) - this bright blue liquid will restore expended mana instantly when consumed
Inferior Stamina Potion (Tier 1) - this bright green liquid will restore expended stamina instantly when consumed.

Well, those would certainly help make staying alive a little easier, as he had four of each type. He grabbed the sling bag, opened it and scooped the books and strange pen into it without giving them a second glance. He could check those out later. He picked up the knife, leaving the bag on the table once more, and checked the edge lightly with his thumb. He then settled the razor sharp blade carefully into its sheath, secured with a knife guard. 
A closer examination of the final pile of cloth revealed it to be a heavy, oilskin cloak with a deep hood. Slowly rolling beside that was a small wooden wand he hadn’t seen on his first glance at the table, which must have been dislodged while he’d grabbed other items. He stared at it, fascinated, before giving himself a shake.
Worrying that he was taking too long, he secured the top of the sling bag and settled the single wide strap over his shoulder and diagonally across his body, tightening it until it felt comfortable. After bouncing around a little on his feet, twisting, turning and otherwise making sure that the bag was secure and wasn’t going to get in his way, he donned the cloak and settled it comfortably before finally turning to the small wand and identifying it.

Common Tutorial Wand (Tier 1)  - A common quality mana weapon capable of reducing the mana cost of spells and abilities channeled through it and improving the accuracy of the wielder in targeting spells and abilities used with it.
Requirements to use: Tutorial participant, sentient race level 1 or higher, Mana Weapons (Tier 1) at Level 1 or better.

He frowned and picked it up. It wasn’t a bad weapon, but if he was out of mana it would be entirely useless. “I don’t suppose I could swap this for a staff instead?”
“That is permissible,” the Guide answered and instantly the wand became a sturdy walking stick. 
It looked and felt like a lacquered length of natural wood, knobbed, slightly crooked, and considerably thicker at one end than the other. He managed to switch his grip without dropping it and hefted it in both of his hands. It had a good weight to it, about what he’d expect from a nice, dense hardwood. He tried to flex it and judge how much give the wood had only to find he wasn’t strong enough to bend it at all. All in all, it was a much better weapon, one he could easily imagine using to brain someone if need be. A quick use of identification revealed it had the same abilities and requirements as the wand. 
“Perfect,” he settled it into his right hand and rested the narrower end on the floor, like the walking stick it resembled. “Anything else I need to do before the tutorial?” he asked again.
“No,” the Guide replied with a shake of her head. “The tutorial begins in four minutes. Good luck and godspeed.”
Deciding to make good use of his last few minutes, Marcus used identify on the over-tunic and cloak.

Common Over-tunic of the Magus (Tier 1) - A basic garment issued to young Magi beginning their Path. Slightly improves mana recovery speed and provides some slight protection from physical attacks while worn. Enchanted to self-repair and self-clean over time.
Requirements: Level 1 or higher in the Magus class, tutorial participant.

Common Tutorial Cloak of Minor Protection (Tier 1) - A basic garment issued to tutorial participants. This cloak is completely water-proof and provides some minor protection from both physical and magical attacks. Enchanted to self-repair and self-clean over time.
Requirements: Tutorial participant, level 1 or higher.

He smiled, pleased with the results. He thought he had felt a slight tingle of Mana in the garments when he first touched them and was happy to see he hadn’t imagined it. He felt as prepared as he could be in such a short amount of time. Taking moments to do some box-breathing and reign in his rising anxieties about what lay ahead, he worked to clear his head.
 
Initiating Tutorial, please stand by.

Marcus found himself transported back to where he’d entered the Dungeon, only instead of the intricately carved stone doors that had been here when he entered, there was nothing there but unadorned wall. It was as if the Dungeon had never existed at all. Should anyone else stumble upon this strange cave, it would likely seem as though it had probably contained treasure box that someone else had already claimed. With a quick thought he pulled up the Tutorial status window.

Tutorial Duration remaining: 123:02:23:46
Tutorial Participants remaining: 4734 of 5000

Weekly Objectives for the Week 1 (03:02:23:03) remaining to complete)
Kill 100 beasts (24/100 complete)
Survive first 48 hours of the Tutorial (02:23:03 remaining for completion)
Earn 100,000 tutorial points (38520/100,000 earned) (Solo Objective)
End the week in top 100 IP scores (Currently 1 of 4734 )

The twenty-eight days and change he’d spent completing the challenge had translated to a touch more than twenty-eight hours out here. What was more concerning, however, was that slightly more than 5% of the tutorial’s participants had died in less than 48 hours. As he considered it, Marcus realized that the first few days were likely the most dangerous part of the Tutorial. The participants were at their weakest: low levels, uncertain about their abilities and skills, most facing a real possibility of painful death for the first times in their lives. So these first days would probably see the deaths of those least suited to this new reality. Within a few days, a week or two at most, the death rate should drop dramatically as those who remained adapted to the danger. After that, most deaths would be from people underestimating a dangerous beast, or overestimating their skills, rather than full on incompetence.
Or at least, that should be the case until the participants started hunting each other. The way the tutorial was structured, other participants who weren’t grouped with you would be the best potential sources of IP, especially later in the tutorial. Marcus had seen more personally than most exactly what kind of people came to prominence when law and order were non-existent. War zones brought out the best and worst in people, and the worst were usually the ones who rose to the top in those situations.
At least there was no incentive for groups to turn on their own members, since there were active penalties for that sort of thing. Which, he abruptly realized, would make solo operators especially vulnerable to that sort of predation. The fact that he had climbed so high in the rankings after his time in the Dungeon would only make him all the more tempting if anyone else were aware of it. He needed to either find a good group to become part of, or to avoid everyone completely for the next four months. And either way, he needed to get stronger to stay alive. He pulled up his personal status to see how he was shaping up after the Dungeon.

Aside from his new Profession skills, he was doing pretty well so far. He hadn’t gained any levels during the challenge Dungeon, but had seen what he considered to be very good skill progress. After studying the screen for a while, he decided that his physical stats were falling too far behind his mental stats and he needed to work on that. He had 17 free stat points so far that he had not spent, so he split them evenly among his physical stats, putting 4 points into each and using the leftover in his weakest physical stat, Strength. With his lowest stat now sitting at 12, he was pretty sure he was comfortably beyond pre-System human limits. The fact that he had also added almost 150 Vitality and a bit more than 200 Stamina with his free points also made him quite happy. 
“The ever pleasant dopamine hit for seeing numbers go up,” he chuckled to himself. Those dopamine hits had been exactly why he had been a gamer before the System and were a helluva motivator now that the System was here.
Feeling a bit better prepared for what lay ahead, Marcus made his way up out of the cave that had held his very first Dungeon and back into the Tutorial at large.

            <Title>Marcus Dragunov</Title>
            <Text>Marcus Dragunov
48 • Fayetteville Area, North Carolina
Role in Story: Protagonist
Goal: Initially to survive and protect the people important to him, goals evolve from there.
Physical Description: Six feet tall, solidly built. Left leg is partially crippled from an accident so he relies on a cane to assist with walking, but fairly healthy and fit otherwise. Short, well kept black hair that has gone significantly silver. Well trimmed mustache and goatee also silvered. Heavily tattooed, wears a number of silver stainless steel rings on each hand along with a number of bracelets of leather braid or stainless steel. Dresses in a utilitarian manner, cargo pants/shorts, tee-shirts, boots. Usually with a sleeveless vest with deep inside pockets over the shirt. When working tends toward either an off-the-shelf business suit with practical shoes for dealing with corporate types, or cargo pants, boots, and polos for less formal work. Still carries obvious traces of a military bearing. Steel grey eyes frequently behind plain sunglasses. Fair skinned, with a roman nose and a sharply planed face. Tends to speak quietly, calmly, with a deep baritone voice.
Personality: Fiercely protective of what he cares about, cynical with a gallows wit, a violent temper that is not easy to provoke, clearheaded and accustomed to coping with crises. Pressure tends to focus him rather than frazzle him. Very Gen-X American, so he either cares a great deal about something or not at all, with little in-between. Struggles with cPTSD and some mild paranoia.
Occupation: Former Military Sniper turned Security Consultant
Habits/Mannerisms: Tends toward hypervigilance. Won’t sit with his back to doors or with someone in a seat directly behind him. Tends to deploy long, uncomfortable silences when thinking or when trying to provoke.  
Background: 
		Only child of an Army Combat Arms Officer and a Civilian Nurse who worked in military hospitals, grew up living a fairly nomadic life. Learned to be self-contained at a young age which turned into becoming self-motivated as he matured. Classic gifted kid school experience, with almost all of his social bonding occurring within gifted classes. Parents were somewhat distant and career focused. Father was a strict disciplinarian bordering on abusive. Mother worked long hours (to avoid his father mainly) and eventually divorced his father while he was deployed when Marcus was in his teens. Lived with mother from the divorce until he graduated high school and visits with his father were infrequent during that time due to his military career. Floundered with what to do with his life until he went on a road trip with his father to celebrate his graduation. They talked a lot, in a much more man-to-man way then they had ever been able to before and Marcus learned that he had a great deal in common with his father, including how he was raised and mistakes that his father made in his marriage and family life. The end result was Marcus enlisting in the Army a few weeks after he returned from his trip.
		Marcus enlisted for a military intelligence analyst role but during basic was discovered to have an exceptional knack for shooting. He was subsequently convinced by his training instructors to switch to a combat role where he trained extensively and excelled, completing the US Army Sniper Course with top marks among other training. He served honorably in a number of military actions over a couple of enlistments as a Sniper until an unlucky parachute landing during an insertion wrecked his left knee. His squad had to scrub the mission and drag him to an emergency extraction. He spent two years going through reconstructive surgeries and rehabilitation before being honorably discharged for medical reasons. 
		After his discharge, Marcus acquired a degree in business management with a minor in psychology before starting up a security consultancy group with a former Army buddy who separated. Combining his military and business background the group became successful enough that he was quite financially stable. 
		Socially, Marcus established a small circle of friends, spending a great deal of his downtime, both in and out of the military, indulging in both online and tabletop roleplaying games. While in college he met his first wife, a relationship that produced a single child and a mostly amicable divorce as he managed to not repeat his father’s (and grandfather’s) mistakes, instead making entirely new ones. He has a pretty good relationship with his child, and is able to interact politely with his ex-wife. These days, he splits his time between work, his gaming habits, and maintaining a good level of physical fitness to keep up appearances for work (people rarely like to engage security consultants who appear out of shape or lazy) and to minimize the issues created by his injury as he gets older. 		
Internal Conflicts: Marcus has difficulties with some of the things he did during his time in the service. He is disillusioned with his home country, his role in private security, capitalism, and life in general. He’s been struggling for sometime now and has been entertaining selling his interest in his security group and looking for something else in his life for some time now.
External Conflicts: In the beginning Marcus’s main external conflict is his partner in his security group not wanting him to leave the group and his general sense of ennui. Once the system integration begins, it becomes adapting to and surviving in a world that is suddenly far more dangerous than before.

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 1

                                                   Part One

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font
used by their house. This PDF file was generated using
Scrivener's compile feature and was created using the &quot;Novel&quot;
project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-
caps about half-way down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

                                                 Chapter Two

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character
during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).
         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                   Part Two

                                               Chapter Three

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert the word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt;
Insert &gt; Draft Word Count. (For a manuscript, you may wish to
have the word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case
select Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest
100--this feature is used on the title page of this manuscript,
in fact.)


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In
reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Text>

Marcus stared at the Tutorial Status panel. The twenty-eight days he’d spent in the Dungeon had translated to a bit more than twenty-eight hours out here. Worse, more than 250 people had died since the tutorial began. Of course, he seemed to remember the System suggesting a 50% death rate for the first year of the Integration, so losing a little more than 5% of the participants in the first couple of days might be within expectations. The Tutorial would like weed out the people who couldn’t adapt to the new reality pretty aggressively from the get go. He also couldn’t help but wonder how many of the dead had been killed by other participants. He knew exactly how badly humans could behave without the threat of punishment to shape their actions.
He looked at the entrance to the dungeon and was surprised to find that the doors were simply gone. The hallway now ended with a plain wall of homogeneous stone, unmarred by any markings whatsoever. Shaking his head slowly, he turned and made his way back up the stairs and out of the cave, spreading his senses as far as he could. 
Once he stepped out of the cave, he felt a low pulse of mana from behind him. Turning back he found the cave was simply gone now, he saw nothing but the uninterrupted slope of the hill. “Well, that’s definitely one way to prevent anyone else from finding it,” he muttered aloud. 
Judging from the light, Marcus figured it was mid-afternoon and began deciding his next step. He pulled up his remaining weekly objectives for this week.



Completing the Dungeon’s objectives and being the first to complete a Dungeon this week had clearly given him a good boost on the leader board for the to 100 IP scores. Now he needed to hunt and earn more IP, to complete the remaining the objectives. Marcus moved to the top of the hill that had contained the dungeon and reached out with his Mana Sense, stretching it out to its furthest limits. Since his Mana Control reached tier 4, the distance he could perceive around him had grown quite a bit. Sadly, nothing of interest caught his attention this time, so he picked a direction and started moving back into the forest surrounding the small hillock.

            <Text>A moment later, Marcus found himself standing in a primeval forest, alone beneath a small dome shaped magical barrier. The trees outside of the dome were impressive, towering hundreds of meters into the sky, with many of them having trunks that were meters wide. The canopy above them wasn’t the thick green wall of jungle canopy, rather it was the mottled green of mixed forest, dappled with sunlight. The temperature was comfortable, reminding Marcus of mid-spring in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, an area he loved to visit from his home in Fayetteville. The air of the forest was also still and silent, lending a powerful sense of isolation from civilization as a whole.
Having gotten a feel for where he was, Marcus started to reach his hand toward the barrier, freezing the motion abruptly when he fingers began tingling.  His hands were still at least 30 centimeters from making contact, and the concentrated mana was already creating an uncomfortable sensation. Touching the barrier might not be a good choice.

Tutorial capacity reached!
5000 of 5000 participants remaining!
Welcome to your Tutorial!

For the duration of this Tutorial, you may earn Integration Points (IP) by killing monsters and completing objectives. The goal of the tutorial is to collect as many IP as you can before the Tutorial ends in 125 days. There will be three types of objectives within the Tutorial: Fixed Objectives, Weekly Objectives, and Hidden Objectives. Fixed Objectives are universal for all participants. They are always available and award points each time they are completed. Weekly Objectives are randomly generated every five days and are only available to complete until the next set is generated. Some Weekly Objectives may be able to be repeated for additional points, others may not. Hidden Objectives are scattered throughout the Tutorial area, only to be revealed when you discover them. Hidden objectives may be more complex and difficult than other objectives within the Tutorial and are therefore the most rewarding. Many hidden objectives are unique, meaning that only one person or group can complete it. 

Additional rules: 
Participants may form teams to work collaboratively during this Tutorial. Such teams will share IP evenly between all members.  
Some dungeons within the Tutorial will restrict the number of participants on a team such that an entire team may not enter together. When this occurs, only the participating team members will get IP for the dungeon.
Killing another Tutorial participant who is or has been a part of your own group within the last 24 hours will result in an IP penalty for all who meet the criteria and participate in the fight. 
Killing other Tutorial participants who either were never a part of your group, or who left your group at least 24 hours ago, will award you 1/2 half the deceased participants accumulated IP. This will be divided according to contribution among all who assist in the kill.
All creatures within the tutorial will award IP based on their Tier and Level. The stronger the foe slain, the more IP it’s death will award. 

Fixed Objectives for the Tutorial:
Kill elites, alphas, and bosses within the Tutorial
Complete Dungeons within the Tutorial
Find Secrets and Legacies within the Tutorial 
Acquire hidden treasures within the Tutorial

Weekly Objectives for the Week 1 (04:23:59:59 remaining to complete)
Kill 100 beasts (0/100 complete)
Find and complete your first dungeon (0/1 complete)
Survive first 48 hours of the Tutorial (47:59:59 remaining for completion)
Earn 100,000 tutorial points (0/100,000 earned) (Solo Objective)
End the week in top 100 IP scores (Currently 5000 of 5000 (tied with 5000 participants) )

Removing containment barriers…
Tutorial Duration remaining 124:23:59:59.

Marcus felt the mana in the barrier melt away, dissolving into the thick, ambient mana of the forest. Taking a long moment, he stood unmoving and just listened to the world around him. No animal sounds, no wind swaying the trees. Nothing. If anything living was nearby, it was as motionless as he was.
Moving cautiously to the trunk of a tree that would make a Californian Sequoia look slender, Marcus laid his hand on the bark softly before flexing his fingers and driving his sharp talons into the tree. It was less difficult than he had feared. Concerned the wood might be too soft for what he intended, he pulled on the tree, attempting to rip away a chuck of the trunk. It was like trying to pry a out a brick mortared into a wall with nothing but his fingertips. He could easily use his claws to scale the tree.
Releasing his grip, Marcus removed his sandals and secured them in his sling bag before slipping his staff through a set of leather straps and buckles that he tightened around it. He flung his cloak back behind his shoulders to free his arms. Using the talons on both his fingers and toes, he began climbing up the tree with the same ease one might see from a squirrel.  He was scarcely a few meters off the ground when the first System notification appeared.

Congratulations! Skill Learned: Natural climbing (Tier 2)!

“Well, nice to see the System is going to acknowledge the skills we already have,” he muttered to himself as he climbed. He tried to pay extra attention to his senses of hearing and smell as he climbed, hoping they might give him some warning if he was heading into the path of an arboreal ambush predator.
[No warnings outside, but] when he was around 100 meters up, he sensed something inside the tree. There seemed to be a magical container of some kind, tucked into the tree itself. Looking around, he saw a dark hollow at a point on the trunk just above where a stout branch emerged from the tree. With a slight shift of his path, Marcus pulled himself around the tree and up to the branch in question. Sure enough, he found what could charitably be called a hollow in the tree. It much more resembled a small open cavern in the trunk, and within that shadowed tree-cave he saw what he could only call a magical chest. It was made of metal, studded with sparkling stones and radiating strong mana. 
Examining the box, Marcus realized he could only sense the mana in the structure of the metal itself. The box was completely shielding what was inside it. [awkward wording, but you’ll fix it ;) ][He focused on the box, studying it closer and using his knowledge of magical theory to understand what its enchantment was doing for a few long minutes. He discovered that it was merely a concealment and locking enchantment.] All it would take to open in was placing his hand on the book and infusing some of his own mana. He started to reach toward it, but froze. [suddenly remembered crucial ability; looking at box like it’s a bomb? ; used “Identify”]

Rare Tutorial Treasure Chest (Tier 1) - Contains a useful item or items of Rare quality usable only by Tutorial participants. Open by infusing with mana to receive contents. (Considered as Rare Tier 1 hidden treasure for objective purposes.)

Well, well, well. That was a good start. Barely a few minutes in and he was about to complete a Fixed objective. Marcus laid his hand on the box and pushed a small amount of his mana into it. The box opened with a loud click that broke the silence around him and startled him into jerking his hand back. He could sense a mana dense object inside the box, as the protective mana dissipated back into the world around him, its purpose completed. Inside the box, he found a metal torc comprised of twisted strands of different metals woven into an intricate cable shaped like a horseshoe. Each end was capped with a stylized talon, apparently carved from some kind of milky colored crystal. [He used “Identify” again.]

Rare Heirloom Draconic Torc (Tier 1) - Increases meditation effectiveness by one tier. Grants wearer ability to sense Draconic treasures within a range determined by Wisdom and Mana Senses.
 
He settled the torc around his neck against his skin and felt it absorb a small amount of his mana to activate its effects. No sooner had he done so, when he received a series of System notifications:

Congratulations! You have been awarded 1600 IP for completing objective ‘Acquire hidden treasures’ with a Rare Tier 1 treasure
Congratulations! You gain Path experience! You gain Class experience!   
Congratulations! You found the first hidden treasure in the Tutorial within the first hour! 
You have earned the title: ‘Natural Treasure Hunter’. Title increases sensitivity and range of all special senses by one full Tier.
Congratulations! You have gained the first unique title in your Tutorial.
You have earned the title: ‘Better lucky than good’. Title grants +10 Luck, +10% to Luck, and doubles the effectiveness of the Luck stat.

Well now, that seemed like a pretty good IP award. The gains to experience for his Path and Class also proved that magical study and learning secrets were going to help him progress. That made his new Treasure Hunter title even more valuable, as it would help him sense more treasure boxes. And the bumps to his Luck stat from the newest title just made him smile. Who didn’t want better Luck after all? 
Marcus turned his attention back to the chest itself, only to see it fade out of existence completely. With a shake of his head, he slipped out of the tree cave and continued his climb, keeping all of his senses, including his magical ones, alert for anything out of the ordinary. Eventually he managed to exit through the top of the canopy and survey the forest as he intended without sensing any other anomalies.  The forest spread out around him for as far as his eyes could see. The uneven canopy top suggesting that the terrain itself raised and dipped throughout the forest, and the handful of breaks and openings he could see spoke to clearings and hopefully some water sources scattered about.
Taking a bearing on what he believed to be the nearest clearing, he fixed the direction in his mind and began a careful descent down the tree trunk. He dropped quietly the last few meters to the ground and spent several long minutes studying his surroundings again carefully. He reached out with all of his senses this time, as he had while he was climbing the tree, but found nothing of note. 
Marcus carefully slipped his staff off his sling bag and settled his cloak back around him. He moved slowly and carefully through the woods, skirting the denser patches of underbrush and stopping briefly to examine every game trail he came across for signs of recent passage. Within an hour or so, he had acquired two new skills and a solid handful of improvements to his mana control. Apparently keeping his magical senses spread out like this was pushing his mana control skill to improve rapidly.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Stealth (General) (Tier 2)!
Congratulations! Skill learned: Tracking (General) (Tier 1)!

He was well into his third hour of picking his way through the forest when he heard the first sounds of something other than himself. The noise reminded him of a cat sharpening its claws against a tree, if the cat was at least the size of a golden retriever. Marcus moved very carefully toward the sound, meaning to try and catch a glimpse of what was making it. An idea of the kinds of animals he might encounter would be welcome at this point after all. After a few more minutes of cautious movement he was peering through the undergrowth at a massive black badger with a wide gray and brown stripe that stretched from the top of it’s head down its entire body busily digging out a large hollow in one of the massive trees.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Marcus whispered to himself before identifying the animal to be sure his eyes weren’t deceiving him.

Juvenile Forest Ratel (Tier 1) Level 3 

It was a fucking Honey Badger. Only this monster was at least three times larger than any such animal he’d ever seen on any of the nature programs he used to enjoy watching with his daughter when she was young. The smaller versions of this thing in his former reality were quite dangerous enough; at this size he was pretty sure anything it caught was on its menu, including Marcus himself.
Moving as slowly and quietly as he could manage, he eased back away from the beast, counting on the noise of its burrowing to cover any incidental noise he caused. It had three levels on him and he’d rather not be forced into a fight unprepared. Abruptly he heard the creature cease burrowing and begin snuffling around. He’d gotten too close and it had picked up his scent.
A moment later it burst through the undergrowth, barreling straight toward him like a bad-tempered, furry missile made of muscle, teeth and claws.  Instantly, Marcus flicked his staff up and activated his mana barrier to defend himself. The animal slammed into it like a small truck, causing the barrier to ripple as it pulled Marcus’s mana into itself to stave off the impact. His Mana pool had dropped by a quarter from the first hit! Instantly he dropped 10 of his free points into Wisdom to bolster his mana pool by 100 points. Using the staff to help reduce the cost of maintaining the barrier, he used his free hand to activate his Mana Bolt skill, pumping as much mana as it would hold into the projectile.
Shaking off the momentary daze from running headlong into an invisible barrier, the giant badger began attacking the barrier with its claws, trying to smash its way through to its intended prey. The mana drain from the barrier was enough to drop Marcus to his knees and almost cost him the mana bolt he’d conjured. His mana pool dropped precipitously under the assault. 
With a momentary burst of his will, Marcus slammed the barrier forward into the badger’s snout as hard as he could, surprising it and dazing it for the barest moment before the barrier shattered completely. Marcus didn’t hesitate, trusting his understanding of the bolt and the marksmanship skills he’d spent so much time honing in the military, he sent the bolt through the badgers left eye. It crossed the short distance like a blaster bolt in a science fiction movie. Physically, the mana bolt resembled a brightly glowing throwing spike with a wickedly sharp point and passed through the eye and into the badger’s brain almost without resistance. And then the bolt exploded from the amount of destructive energy poured into it, converting the badger’s entire head into a spray of fine red mist.
Marcus collapsed backward, his mana pool empty and his head pounding from expending so much energy in such a short period of time. On the plus side, however, the System notifications made it seem worth the brief bout of desperate struggle for survival.

He felt the warm rush of stat increases, followed by the flood of renewed mana and stamina from his increased stats and level. It seemed that his Race Level was the one that must affect his resource gains as it was the one that awarded Free points for leveling up. It also seemed his Race Level increased by one every time his Path or Class level increased. He presumed Profession levels would have the same effect. Marcus finally opened his full status screen to see where he now stood after his recent gains.

            <Text>As darkness crept over the forest, Marcus discovered just how well his racial darkvision worked, which was to say very well indeed. Apparently his eyes were very well adapted to gathering what light was available and focusing it in a way that made it easy for him to distinguish shapes and movements. Which was a very good thing when he heard the rustling of a large animal moving through the undergrowth, allowing him to quickly spot the approaching trouble. Trouble that was shaped like an even larger honey badger than the one he’d slain earlier. 

Mature Forest Ratel (Tier 1) Level 9

The animal was clearly following a scent trail, but Marcus wasn’t sure what the trail had been made by until it found the juvenile badger he had killed earlier. It snuffled around the corpse and growled when it seemed to catch a second scent, leaving Marcus with a big problem. It was almost certainly his scent the beast had found, as it was heading directly toward the tree he was currently in. Given the aggressively territorial nature of honey badgers, and their renown for climbing trees, he was unlikely to escape a fight. 
Luckily, he was in a much better position overall than he had been during the earlier fight. He had a good line of sight on the badger, which had not yet seen him. He focused and conjured a mana spike, blasting it down at the approaching creature’s head. Unlike the previous encounter with the juvenile, the angle was all wrong for a quick killing blow and he didn’t overcharge the bolt. The spikes did not penetrate deeply, exploding on impact against the badger’s thick skull. He rained down a series of the exploding spikes, eliciting  squeals, growls and barks from the creature as it rushed to the tree and began climbing. [Sadly for the badger, covering that much ground under an assault from a Magus who held the higher ground was too much to ask.] It was perhaps 6 meters below Marcus when he landed a final bolt which pierced through the thinner flesh of the badgers vulnerable neck and exploded, severing the spine.

Three more levels and some skill improvements, that was pretty good for as little risk as his tactics had exposed him to.  He pulled up his resource pools to see how his levels affected them.

Vitality:  334/334
Mana: 1110/1650		Mana Core Compression (Tier 1)
Stamina: 245/245
Soul Strength: 199/199
Free points remaining: 9/19

He’d thrown more mana at this foe than he’d even had for the first fight and still had a fair bit left in the tank if he needed it. Now if only he had more effective spells to use. His Explosive Mana Spikes were good when he could pierce the enemy and have them explode in the wound they left, but when they exploded on impact a good bit of the force was dispersed. Sadly, without a light source he could hardly study his theory primer and look for a method to improve them and he had no desire to attract the kind of attention a light might draw. 
As he recalled, ratels were mostly solitary and fiercely territorial by nature. Unless the System had changed that, he should be safe where he was for some time. Few predators willingly challenged honey badgers after all, and it would at least take some time for the local competition to work up the courage to test the badger’s territory.  
Marcus resumed his meditation position and spent several long minutes reviewing aspects of the Magical Theory that the System had forcibly loaded into his brain. As he understood it, if he could unlock his racial elemental affinity, he should be able to infuse that element into his bolts and barriers for additional effects. It was just a matter of identifying it and spending some time familiarizing himself with the feel of that sort of elemental mana. 
So he sank back into meditation, turning his focus inward and tried to submerge his senses into his Mana Core. It was a slow and deliberate process, but after some time, he managed it. He could feel the mana brushing along his projected consciousness, could feel the power in it and he focused on that feeling. His senses tingled with the power of the Mana, his nostrils filling with the acrid tang of corrosion and the slight burn of ozone. He studied his mana for a long time and was startled to discover two potent affinities within it. The stronger of the two was a powerful corrosive affinity, which suggested an acid spitting dragon of some sort. The nominally weaker affinity was a lightning affinity, only that didn’t really make sense. He was supposed to have a single powerful elemental affinity from his race, wasn’t he.
So he studied the mana even more closely, spending a few hours manipulating it and seeing how it responded. Which was how he discovered it wasn’t two separate affinities at all. It was a single affinity that combined aspects of the acid and lightning affinities to form some kind of caustic eldritch lightning, a lightning that burns, shocks and can even dissolve what it strikes. What the hell kind of dragon used that as a breath weapon? Apparently the kind his Dragonkin bloodline was descended from.
He exited his meditation and checked his pending System notifications to see what he could learn.

Path experience awarded for discovering your racial elemental affinity!
Path: Seeker of Power has reached level 4!
Race Dragonkin-Hybrid (Rare) (Corrosive Lightning) (Tier 1) has reached Level 7! Free point awarded..

Seeing as there still appeared to be some hours before sunrise, Marcus turned his attention to imbuing his Mana Spikes and Mana Barrier with his elemental affinity. A barrier that damaged those that struck it and spikes of corrosive lightning seemed like excellent additions to his arsenal. Especially if the affinity made it easier for the spikes to penetrate enemy defenses.
It was a process of trial and error and wasted a lot of mana, but as the world began to lighten ever so slightly, Marcus found a technique that worked without losing the explosive aspect of his Mana Spikes. He could wrap the inner, explosive core in a thin shell of neutral mana and then wrap that shell with his corrosive lightning. The neutral mana kept the corrosive lightning from interacting with the explosive core so that the spike would hit its target, causing the corrosive lightning to attack its target and let the spike penetrate deeply. Then the neutral shell would shatter and the core would explode. 
Similarly, he layered the outer face of his mana barrier with the corrosive lightning, with a small gap between it and the protective layer of the barrier that he filled with more of the extremely stable neutral mana. The corrosive lightning would damage anyone and anything that struck it, while the neutral mana would help stabilize the protective portion of the barrier and toughen it.  Which left him with a much more potent defense.

Congratulations! Explosive Mana Spikes (Class) (Tier 2) has evolved to Imbued Explosive Mana Spikes (Class) (Tier 2)!
Congratulations! Mana Barrier (Class) (Tier 2)  has evolved to Imbued Retributive Barrier (Class) (Tier 2)!
 
Marcus spent another hour in meditation to refill his mana and stamina pools, before standing up and stretching. He decided that yesterday’s overly cautious approach wasn’t what he needed. He needed to increase his efforts to explore and find the secrets and legacies hidden in the Tutorial as well as the Dungeons it had made reference to. He had four days to complete a Dungeon, kill 98 more beasts and earn 95,800 IP if he wanted to complete all the weekly objectives he was sure were doable. Finishing in the top 100 scores for the week was really out of his hands after all, it would either happen or it wouldn’t while he worked on more concrete goals.
He spread his senses out once more, sweeping the area for any Mana concentrations that might lead him to something interesting. The improvements in his Mana Control skill had a massive impact on his ability to sense Mana, stretching his senses out to more than a 100 meter radius around him. Marcus oriented himself back in the direction he had been traveling yesterday and began moving purposefully while searching for treasures.

            <Title>Apocalypse Now-ish</Title>
            <Text>Marcus used progressive relaxation techniques for his weary muscles while he sat in the hotel concourse, people-watching before heading to his room. There was something uniquely appealing about the strange slice of the world that was a Las Vegas resort hotel and casino. Some people were busy throwing money away in the hopes of striking it rich. Others were just smiling and pretending they didn’t hate their jobs as they dealt with stuck up pricks. He watched some couples and friends argue about who’s fault it was as they lost more money than they could afford, and watched others embrace in celebration as they won big. After about half an hour, he felt his phone vibrate with a text message and fished it out to see it was an apology from Craig, who asked for a week to come up with a counter to Jimmy’s offer. Marcus replied that he had until the day he was back from this trip to make a solid offer before turning his phone completely off. 
He pushed himself to his feet, feeling his leg complain again at the motion. He leaned heavily on his cane as he made his way to a nearby VIP elevator and tapped his room card to the access reader. He once again thanked his own foresight for splurging on the VIP package as trudging all the way back to the main elevators definitely did not appeal at the moment. A few short moments later, the elevator door slid open with a soft ding and Marcus slipped inside. He tapped his room card on the inside control panel and slumped against the side of the elevator. The doors closed with a second soft ding and he felt the elevator smoothly rise up its shaft.
He smiled as the silence of the elevator car enveloped him, the first real silence he’d experienced in the Devil only knew how many hours. Then, after a scant handful of floors, the lights in the elevator flickered and died, plunging the enclosed space into complete darkness as the machine stopped dead in its tracks.
“What the hell?” Marcus muttered aloud into the darkness. “A power outage shouldn’t have killed the emergency lights too.” 
Standing up straighter and leaning on his cane, Marcus turned toward the elevator’s control panel and began feeling around blindly for the emergency button. If nothing else, he needed to notify someone that he was trapped.
Suddenly, what looked like a holographic computer screen appeared floating in front of him in the pitch black space. In glowing letters a message began appearing on the screen:

System Initializing…
Attention denizens of the Milky Way: your universe has evolved sufficient sentient life for integration into the Multiverse System.  
Beginning Analysis: Planet Sol-3 (Local Designation: Earth)
Single World Technological Civilization identified… 
Warning: Planet size insufficient for sentient population — Terraforming required.

Integration plan approved by System

Preparing Mana Adaptation process… Adaptation duration 24 hours
Preparing System Introduction… Introduction duration 1 hour
Preparing System Tutorials… Tutorial duration 125 days
Beginning Integration of Planet Sol-3 (Local Designation: Earth)

Please Stand By…

“What the fuck?” The words slipped out of Marcus’s mouth automatically as he read the messages that began appearing on the screen. The whole thing looked like some sort of boot up sequence. When he tried to look around for the source of the screen, it just stayed centered in his vision. And the whole message was just mind boggling. Multiverse System? Mana? Integration? What did any of that even mean? Was he losing his mind? Having some sort of weird mental break? Having a stroke?

Beginning Mana Adaption…
Welcome to the Multiverse.

Marcus had just enough time to register the two new lines on the screen before a sensation of falling overtook him. He was unconscious before he hit the floor of the elevator.</Text>

            <Text>Tutorial Duration remaining: 124:06:36:12

Marcus spent the next few hours navigating the forest and dealing with the more aggressive beasts he encountered. His imbued Mana spikes and imbued barriers were every bit the improvement he had hoped they would be, allowing him to handle a few groups of lower level beasts with ease as well as a single, stronger creature that he encountered at the  base of a large hill. A hill that held a cave with a very strong mana signature deep within it. 
He spent several minutes studying the mouth of the cave and the ground before it, looking for the tracks of any animals that might call it home. Finding no tracks actually entering the cave, he carefully made his way inside. After a couple steps, Marcus realized this was no natural cave. It wasn’t apparent from the overgrown outside, but the entryway was a carved stone archway engraved with magical formations to deter animals from entering. The walls were smooth flat stone blocks that had once been sheathed in pristine white plaster that was now broken and crumbling. 
At the back of the deep entryway, a spiral stone staircase descended into the ground. His Mana senses insisted that was where he would find the Mana signature he’d been following. So he began his descent, carefully edging into the growing darkness. As he finished the first full turn of the spiral he should have been plunged into complete blackness, instead a series of small crystals set into the wall at waist height flickered to life and began radiating a soft blue-white radiance to illuminate the area. He continued his cautious descent, testing each stair with the end of his staff before stepping down onto it. It took a total of seven turns of the spiral to reach the bottom of the stairs, which ended in a black corridor some five meters wide with a vaulted ceiling. 
When he crossed the threshold of the corridor, torches set in sconces at intervals along the walls burst to life with an eerie bluish-green flame that gave off light without heat or smoke. At the far end of the hall, some 50 meters ahead, the corridor was sealed by a pair of large, intricately carved stone doors. As Marcus stopped and examined the engravings, his Lingual Savant ability activated and he could suddenly read the words carved into the lintel of the doorway.

“In Discovery we find Truth. In Truth we find Freedom.” 

He carefully ran his hand over a beautifully detailed engraving of a rampant European dragon, exhaling flames at its foes, bringing up a System prompt.

You have discovered the Legacy Challenge Dungeon: Secrets of the Past! 12,800 IP awarded for being the first to discover this secret location!
You have uncovered a hidden objective: Complete the Secrets of the Past and claim its legacy (0/2).
Tutorial Dungeon requirements: Must be level 5 or higher in a sentient Race.
Challenge Dungeon rules: 
Only 1 individual may enter this Dungeon at a time. 
This Dungeon may only be attempted once per individual.
Once completed successfully, this Dungeon cannot be attempted by any other individual. 
Dying in this Dungeon will result in failure, but the participant will be fully restored and returned to the Dungeon entrance.
No participant may spend more than 30 days (subjective) in this Dungeon.  

Warning: This Legacy Challenge Dungeon exists outside of local space-time constraints. One day in the Dungeon is one hour here.

Do you wish to attempt Legacy Challenge Dungeon: Secrets of the Past? 

Now that was a hell of an opportunity. First crack at a Dungeon that only one person can ever complete successfully. His only real question was what was the difference between a Dungeon and a Legacy Challenge Dungeon? So he asked the System.

Legacy Challenge Dungeons are a special type of Dungeon event, usually limited to a single participant. These events are normally focused on presenting the participant with specific types of obstacles in an effort to identify if they are worthy of inheriting a specific Legacy. Successful completion of a Legacy Challenge Dungeon usually rewards a powerful Race, Path, Class, or Profession as well as potent items intended for that Race, Path, Class or Profession. You cannot be permanently killed within any Challenge Dungeon.
 Legacy Challenge Dungeons are only found during the Tutorials offered as part of integrating a new Universe. 
Warning: Refusing the Legacy rewarded by such a Dungeon invalidates Dungeon completion and results in automatic failure of that Dungeon.

And that was a good enough explanation for him. He accepted the prompt and blinked as he was suddenly somewhere else entirely. </Text>

            <Title>Awakening</Title>
            <Text>Marcus woke up slowly, his head feeling as though it were wrapped in wool, but not in pain. His mouth was dry and he felt cold tile beneath his bare back. Which made no sense as the last thing he remembered was being in a carpeted elevator and wearing his vest and a tee shirt. He groggily opened his eyes only to be confronted with yet another screen in the center of his vision.

Welcome to the Multiverse.
Mana adaptation process successful!
Unexpected race evolution detected! 
Customizing Introduction sequence…
Initializing Introduction, please stand by…
Introduction period begins in 0:04:59

Beyond the semi-transparent screen, he could see that he was lying on his back staring up at a white ceiling. The room was well lit, but with no clear source of illumination. 
Groaning, he forced himself to a sitting position, which allowed him to take in the rest of the room he was in. The square room was entirely white and completely empty aside from himself. Smooth white ceiling and walls, cold white tile floor, no windows or doors. Even the light in the room seemed to be a soft white color. No distinguishing features anywhere that he could he see.
And he was naked. No sign of his clothes, his phone, his cane, or even an entrance to the strange room. He rubbed his hands over his face and frowned. The skin on his face felt… different. Strange. There were patches on his cheeks and brow around his eyes that felt rough and almost scaly. He frantically felt around the rest of his face, and thankfully nothing else there felt wrong. Then he looked at the rest of his body, noticing patches of dark brown to almost black scales on his torso, arms and legs. 
“What the ever-loving fuck!” he scrambled to his feet in a panic.
And that wasn’t all. His fingers were slightly longer and more slender than he remembered, and tipped in hard pointed talons. His toes were tipped in somewhat shorter versions of the same. Even the skin that wasn’t scaly looked rougher and had darkened somewhat to an almost sandy tan color. 
And his body, aside from his face and head, was hairless!
“Your mana adaptation activated dormant traits in your pattern,” a flat emotionless female voice said from behind him. “This resulted in changes to your physical and metaphysical bodies.”
Marcus whirled to find a tall, slender woman behind him where no one had been moments before. Like him, she had patches of scales around her eyes, on her forehead and down the visible portions of her arms. Unlike him, her scales were the vibrant green of living vegetation. He also noticed her eyes resembled those of a snake or lizard, with a vertical slit instead of a round pupil.
It was at this point that he realized the screen he’d been seeing had vanished. “What the hell! What’s going on here?” he gasped out, instinctively covering his dangly bits (which thankfully seemed unchanged) at sight of the woman. Lizard-woman?
“Where am I? Where are my clothes? Who are you?” Marcus’s heart was hammering in his chest.
“What’s going on is your universe is being integrated into the Multiverse by the System. You are currently in the Introduction sequence, an experience intended to help you understand the changes to your world and prepare you for the tutorial.” Her voice remained even, with the sort of flat affect he was more accustomed to hearing from AI generated voices reading a script. “Your clothes and belongings were destroyed by exposure to the intense mana required to trigger your mana adaptation. I am your Guide to the Introduction.”

            <Title>Cassandra Blake</Title>
            <Text>Cassandra Blake
25 • Las Vegas, Nevada
Role in Story: Supporting cast/sidekick
Goal: Surviving and keeping her half-sister safe
Physical Description: Before the System, Cassandra was nerdy-cute with a slight roundness of features that made her seem even younger than she actually was. Her figure had been soft and inviting, but not so much to be considered chubby. She had been dressed as a popular character from an obscure anime and stood a touch more than 5 ft tall. After the System, she has been transformed into a fox-girl. She is a touch taller now and more svelte though still uncomfortably curvaceous from Marcus’s point of view. 
Personality: Cassie, as she prefers to be called, is the epitome of a bold, vivacious, self-confident young woman. She flirts with anyone who catches her eye and happily takes to bed any are up to her standards. Very free-spirited and lives in the moment. She doesn’t really believe in love but definitely believes in having fun where ever she can find it.
Occupation: Dealer at a Casino
Habits/Mannerisms: 
Background: Daughter of a show girl and one of her flings, Cassie was born and raised the Vegas way: everyone was running some kind of game and everyone swore they were going to be rich and famous someday. She grew up backstage with dancers, having brunch with hookers, and seeing the good and the bad of both lifestyles. It was Vegas after all, and almost anything goes in Vegas. Like many a jaded child of the Life, she grew up pragmatic and quick on her feet. Now she’s on the grind, working her way off the casino floor and into the back office through work and dedication.

            <Title>Introduction to the System</Title>
            <Text>As soon as he read the last word on the screen, his Guide became animated once more and spoke, “Welcome to the Introduction period. During this period you be taught the basics of interacting with the System and be given an opportunity to select your initial Path in the Multiverse.” 
“Can I continue to ask questions during this time?” Marcus cut in when she paused. 
“Within acceptable limits, yes,” the Guide answered flatly. “First you must learn to access the System and the limited help functions provided to newly adapted sentients. Begin my speaking the phrase ‘status screen’ while consciously choosing your status to appear.”
Marcus frowned slightly and obeyed, “Status screen.” Immediately a screen similar to the one he had been seen before appeared in front of him.

Holy shit, he had a character sheet. Skimming through it he understood most of the basics from context. Vitality would probably be an abstraction of how much physical injury he could endure without dying. Mana was… well, if this were a game it would probably be how much energy he could use to cast spells or do magic. Stamina probably measured how long he could exert himself physically before becoming exhausted. Soul strength was… too ambiguous for him to be sure, but maybe some sort of measure of his psyche? 
Strength, Endurance, Willpower, and Luck all seemed pretty self explanatory, but the others needed clarifications. He opened his mouth to speak, only to have the Guide cut him off.
“The status screen may dismissed with the command ‘hide status’,” she said abruptly. “The ‘show’ and ‘hide’ commands may be used on any System display, permitting you to, for example, only see your resource pools by using the command ‘show resources’. Limited System help files are also available to explain basic information. These are accessed by using the command ‘Help’ and then stating the topic.”
He blinked, then whispered, “Help, Agility.” Instantly a notification popped up in front of the status screen, with an arrow pointing to his Agility.

Agility is a stat measuring your gross motor control, your ability to coordinate and control the large muscle groups in your body. This affects balance, ability to position your body, and movement speed. It also contributes somewhat to ranged accuracy, but considerably less so than Dexterity. 

Okay, so Agility was for running, dodging, gymnastic movements, fast aiming, those sorts of things. He could totally accept that, so Dexterity must be more about fine motor control and precision tasks.  That left him needing to know the difference between Wisdom and Intelligence. As he opened his mouth to speak the commands he needed to use, the Guide cut in once again.
“Now that you have had a moment to try a few verbal commands, be aware you can also issue commands non-verbally by simply focusing your thinking with the intent of issuing commands directly to the System,” the Guide explained. “This is particularly useful when you are trying to move undetected.”
Frowning again, Marcus wished away the Agility notification, and instantly it vanished. He blinked in surprise. Apparently the System could listen to his thoughts. That was more than a bit creepifying.  
“No, the System cannot read minds,” the Guide immediately explained, undermining its own assertion. “But if you direct a thought at the System intentionally, then the System will receive it.”
That was less creepy, thank all the gods. Also, it seemed like the System had performed enough integrations to be able to anticipate and preemptively answer the most common questions, which made sense. Turning back to the task at hand, Marcus willed the System to show the help file for Wisdom.

Wisdom is a stat measuring your ability to evaluate the reliability of data and accurately weight that reliability in your decision making process. It also reflects your intuition and ability to comprehend esoterica. It factors heavily in the depth of your mana pool and is tied to your ability to instinctively manipulate mana and conditionally improves your soul strength.

He nodded slowly, willing away that notification and checking the help for Intelligence as well, to make sure he didn’t make any bad decisions. 

Intelligence is a stat measuring how quickly you can think and analyze data, how quickly you can learn and assimilate new knowledge, your ability to apply logic and rationality, and to extrapolate from concrete ideas and information. It greatly affects the speed at which you can advance your understanding of your skills and may conditionally improve the strength and efficiency of spells and abilities.

And there was back-handed confirmation that magic was real and he probably was right about what Mana was for. So, he skipped that and moved on to the last thing he was unsure about.

Soul Strength is a stat measuring how stable your sense of self is. It is primarily determined by your Willpower and, to a much lesser extent, your Wisdom. It is the only one of your resource pools not directly increased by leveling, instead being increased only by stats and your overall power tier. Mental exertion, heavy concentration, mental trauma and psychic attacks all reduce your Soul Strength. Expending all of your Soul Strength leaves you vulnerable to mental or magical manipulation and control. 

Alright, it was a combination of mental vitality and stamina. He could follow that well enough. Classes and professions seemed mostly self-explanatory. He needed a little more information though before he could continue. First off, free points…

Free points are stat points acquired by advancing your Race tier, your Path tier, your Class tier, your Profession tier, or your Level. Each Level grants a single free point. Tier based free points vary by Race, Path, Class and Profession. These points may allocated to any stat at any time.

Okay, so that was how he could increase his stats, which meant that stats could be increased. Good information to have going into what is essentially an entirely new world. He couldn’t even begin to imagine what Earth was going to be like if being part of the Multiverse immediately added an RPG video game interface system to reality that also apparently included magic…
Stay focused, he chided himself. Time is fleeting, so logic and rationality now, panic later. He opened the help for Paths. 

Paths are an expression of an individual’s preferred methods of self improvement and advancement within the Multiverse. A sentient being’s Path affects the nature of the classes and professions that become available to them, as well as the ways they earn experience toward the next Level. It may also greatly affect the skills and abilities available by means of Class and/or Profession. 

That was a little more basic than he’d hoped, but he reckoned that it was a sort of archetype that would narrow down the choices he would have later on. Which left one more thing to consider, that being his Race, which apparently was no longer human.

Dragonkin-Hybrid (Rare) (Unknown): The product of interbreeding between a Dragonkin and another of the sentient Races. A Dragonkin-Hybrid carries some of the advantages of their Dragonkin ancestor and is visually distinctive from both full Dragonkin and his other racial heritage. They are highly sensitive to Mana and instinctively grasp how to manipulate Mana. All Dragonkin and Dragonkin-Hybrids are also possessed of a very potent elemental affinity as a result of their draconic blood, Your affinity is currently UNKNOWN 
Race grants +7 free stat points per tier
WARNING: most hybrid Races will eventually make choices that may result in them evolving closer to their Dragonkin or other racial heritage instead of remaining true hybrids.

So, he was a half-Dragonkin, half-Human then, Marcus supposed. He could live with that. It wasn’t like having been a human had ever been some great achievement or something. In fact, Marcus was pretty sure that 99% of humans in the Multiverse probably weren’t worth putting out if they were on fire. His former race had spent thousands of years committing atrocities upon one another, after all. As Marcus closed the notifications and his Status screen, the Guide spoke up once again. 
“Now that you have a basic understanding of how to interact with the System and the information it will provide you with, the time has come to select a starting Path. The initial Path you choose will determine if you are permitted to select a Class or a Profession to begin the tutorial, and if so, which Classes or Professions are offered to you.” 
He quickly opened his mouth to speak, only to be cut off once more.
“Paths, Classes, and Professions are not finalized until the completion of the tutorial,” the Guide continued to explain. “This means you most likely will encounter opportunities during the tutorial to refine or change the choices you make today. However, after the tutorial is completed, there will only be two ways for you to change your Path, or an already selected Class or Profession. The first, more common way, is during a tier advancement. The other way is by the acquisition of titles related to certain achievements or experiences, which are very rare by the standards of the Multiverse, but are somewhat more common for sentients during their initial years of System integration.”
Marcus closed his mouth and put his hand down.
“Are you ready to choose a Path, or do you have additional questions?” the Guide asked before warning, “Only 45 minutes remain in this introductory period.”
Marcus had one pertinent question left, “How do we increase Levels and Tiers?” 
“The help file on advancement will give you more personalized information on that topic after the selection of your Path and Class or Profession,” the Guide answered. “Generally, however, it will require you to hone the skills you acquire and undertake actions to acquire experience.”
He nodded, “Fair enough, then. I’m ready to choose a Path, I guess.”

            <Title>Initiate Tutorial</Title>
            <Text>Marcus appeared alone in a large circular room some 15 meters in diameter with a high, domed roof. A mild sense of dread filled him. Feeling uncomfortably exposed, he raised the hood of his cloak to hide his face as other people began to pop into existence in the room. Most of them appeared to be plain old, vanilla humans, but he was thankful for his hood when he noticed that several of them regarded the smattering of non-human faces with suspicion. 
It was the non-human faces, however, that caught the majority of Marcus’s attention. There were a couple of elves, a dwarf, and a few of what he could only call beast-folk as they displayed an interesting mixture of human and animal features. Out of curiosity, he used his identify skill on one, a very pretty fox-girl in what looked like leather armor, with a rapier on one hip. 

Name: Cassie
Power: Tier: 1 - Level 1
Race: Kitsune (Tier 1)

He froze on seeing the name. The identify skill should only put names on people who had introduced themselves to him, but… Wait. Unless it was the flirty anime girl he met on the bus? But, no surely not. That Cassie hadn’t been quite so tall or svelte or… uncomfortably curvaceous… Had she? Fuck, he couldn’t be attracted to a furry girl who was probably younger than his daughter, could he? And now she was looking this way because he had been staring too hard. He felt the faint brush of mana as someone, presumably named Cassie, identified him.
Yep, it was definitely her because now she was walking over to him with a sly grin. “Marcus!” she greeted him excitedly and threw her arms around him in a tight hug. Then she whispered near his ear, so that only he could hear her, “Go with it, please, I’m trying to ditch a creeper.”
His spine stiffened at her words, his Neanderthal brain immediately insisting that he protect the young lady. Unfortunately, she’d noticed during the hug that his spine wasn’t the only thing that had stiffened a bit. He could tell from the wicked twinkle in her eye when she pulled back a little, right before she pressed her pelvis more firmly against him.
“Cassie, love,” he responded with a slightly sheepish smile he hoped no one could see, “I’m so glad you’re here. I was afraid I might never see you again.” 
She quickly leaned in and kissed him, which was surprisingly warm and soft and deep and… yeah, wow. It had been a very long time since he’d been kissed like that. As she pulled back after thoroughly checking out the inside of his mouth with her tongue, she murmured, “Mmmmm, good kisser too.” Then she spoke up louder for everyone else to hear, “Damn, am I glad to see you. At least I have one person I can trust in this insanity.”
They hugged again and Marcus noticed over Cassie’s shoulder an angry guy about Cassie’s age glaring daggers at him. “Ex?” he whispered in her ear.
“He wishes,” she whispered back, “just a sleeze who saw a sexy fox-girl and thought I’d be an easy lay.”
“So I’m the over protective boyfriend?” he asked.
“Nah, you’re the over protective daddy,” she pulled back and winked looking him right in the eye and putting on a lascivious pout, “or don’t you want to be my daddy… Daddy?”
Marcus felt his face heating, proving that he still had a physical blush reaction, though he hoped it didn’t show through his new scales. 
“Teasing me to the point that my brain shuts off is not gonna be super helpful for dealing with the slime ball”, he managed to quietly hiss through a fake, toothy smile.
“Who said I’m teasing?” She grinned wickedly. “I already thought you were hot and sweet back on the bus. Now, though? This whole dragon thing you’ve got going on is beyond sexy.”
“Hold that thought,” he said before turning his gaze on the young man that was stomping toward him. Marcus reached up and pushed his hood back, fixing the sleaze with what he expected was an extremely unsettling reptilian gaze. He reached out casually, resting his hand on the small of Cassie’s back and gently pulling her close to him without ever looking away from the guy or blinking.
“Do you have a problem, Junior?” He intentionally exaggerated the sibilance in his voice as he spoke, to play up the strangeness. Marcus arched one eye brow at the young idiot expectantly. “Thiss one iss mine. Go find your own.” 
The young man’s face twisted with anger and a touch of fear, but he stepped back. “Bunch of freaks,” he finally spat, turning away and stomping off.
Cassie relaxed against Marcus slightly. “Thanks,” she said with a sigh. “He gave me a really bad vibe, and I have a feeling he wasn’t in the mood for a no.”
“It’s no problem,” Marcus still hadn’t shifted his gaze away from the boy, nor blinked. “I don’t mind helping out. You seem like a good kid, in spite of flirting with a guy who’s old enough to be your actual Father.”
She clutched her hand to her heart melodramatically and affected a Shakespearean air, “You wound me good sir, for I am no teasing slattern.” She pushed in closer, pressing her fluffy body into him. “I am but a fair maiden looking for a right fair prick.” The twinkle of mischief in her eye mocked him. “And as for the rest, age is a number. Besides, it’s the end of the world as we know it. Surely that… changes the rules a bit right?”
Marcus was saved from having to answer that by the appearance of a System window.

Tutorial capacity reached! 
5000 of 5000 participants remaining!
Welcome to your Tutorial!
Tutorial duration remaining 124:22:59:59
For the duration of this Tutorial, you may earn Integration Points by killing monsters and completing objectives! The group that has the most Integration Points (IP) per member will be declared victorious at the end of the Tutorial period. There will be three kinds of objectives with the Tutorial: Fixed objectives, Weekly objectives, and Hidden objectives. Fixed objectives are always available to complete, do not change and can be repeated. Rewards for Fixed objectives are based on the difficulty of the task you performed to complete them. Weekly objectives will change every 7 days and each one can only be completed once per week for points. All Weekly objectives reward the same amount of points, which vary from week to week. Hidden objectives will be revealed when you encounter them. They are by far the most rewarding objectives to achieve and tend to be the most difficult as well. 
Additional rules:
Groups of more than 10 will be treated as multiple groups of 10 or less for scoring purposes. Such sub-groups will be based on IP contributions to ensure that those with the highest contribution are positioned to receive the best overall scores and rewards.
Initial Groups may be changed, disbanded, or merged starting 24 hours after the first IP point is awarded in the Tutorial. When group compositions change, each member retains their full individual IP contributions.
The death of a group remember will result in their share of earned IP being deducted from the groups total as if they had voluntarily left the group.
Killing someone within your group will award no IP and result in overall group IP being reduced by the dead member’s contribution amount.
Killing someone outside of your group will award you 1/2 of the IP that are deducted from their group as a result of member death.
The more dangerous the opponent you face, the more IP that will awarded. If multiple groups engage an opponent IP will be divided between the groups based on the value of their contribution to the fight.

Fixed objectives:
Kill alpha beasts within the tutorial area.
Complete Dungeons within the tutorial area. 
Find secrets within the tutorial area.
Acquire hidden treasures within the tutorial area.

You have one hour to form groups after which all groups will be distributed to random locations throughout the Tutorial area and the Tutorial will commence with the reveal of the first set of Weekly objectives.

Good Luck and try not to die!</Text>

            <Title>Adaptation</Title>
            <Text>Marcus felt his head spinning, his heart hammering in his chest, as the adrenaline in his system put his brain into what his ex-wife had always called “crisis mode.” He closed his eyes and focused on deepening his breathing, allowing his emotions to shut off and his rational mind to take over. 
He began to analyze the situation logically and considered what he had experienced so far, taking stock of everything: the strange floating screens, the obvious and palpable changes to his physical body, the complete lack of pain in his leg for the first time in literal decades, the strange green woman standing in front of him. None of it made sense.
Could he be suffering some manner of psychotic break? Possibly. However, so far everything was coherent, and he could follow both the information provided by the strange screens and the answers provided by the woman. His ability to think clearly and analyze the data he was being given didn’t appear to be impaired, even if the data itself and resulting conclusions were outrageous by any objective standard. That didn’t fit with the fractured reasoning associated with severe mental breaks, did it?
Likewise, the clarity of his thoughts seemed to contradict the possibility he had been drugged or injured. It didn’t fully discount the possibility of hallucinations from some other cause, but again that seemed unlikely. His general understanding was that while hallucinating, it was almost impossible to consider that you might be hallucinating. Also, would a delusion be so consistent, fooling all of his senses in a rational manner? That didn’t seem probable.
Was he actually thinking clearly though? He tested himself, running through a set of mathematical calculations he’d had ingrained in his memory for long distance shooting. He didn’t stumble or stutter over any step of the equations, so he could only conclude he was, indeed, thinking clearly. That left him faced with Occam’s Razor: the simplest explanation that fits the facts is the most probable explanation. Therefore, he should proceed from the assumption that this was really happening until something proved that it wasn’t.
He considered the woman’s responses. She gave direct answers to the questions he’d posed, without volunteering additional information or providing context. That was not typical human conversational behavior. At the same time, she had interpreted his initial outburst as a question and responded accordingly, indicating that she was capable of grasping and answering implied questions as well. There were no value statements or emotional emphasis on anything she said, which suggested that she answered with what she perceived to be statements of fact rather than opinion. That at least provided a path to acquire more information. She had also calmly remained silent during his introspection, with no change of expression. He stared at her, waiting to see if she blinked. She did.
“You’re my guide? What does that mean?” he asked finally.
“I am a System projection intended to help you navigate the changes brought about by the first phase of System integration and to prepare you for the tutorial,” she answered. “That means I am here to answer relevant questions for you, teach you basic conceptual knowledge about the System and the Multiverse it governs, and help you assess options and select a path forward.”
“I see,” he said as he considered her response. “A System projection? Does that mean you aren’t real? You’re a hologram or something?”
“I am not a hologram, I am a material projection. A physical manifestation of a limited set of System functions intended to interact with sentient beings in universes that are being integrated into the Multiverse.”
“But you aren’t a fully sentient being yourself?”
“No. I am not classed as sentient as the System is not classed as sentient. While I have some ability to reason and communicate like sentient beings, I do not have a sense of my self as an individual. I exist to serve a purpose and when that purpose is fulfilled I cease to be.” She paused for a moment as though thinking. “It would be easiest for you to consider me an automaton.”
“Why do you appear to be the same as me? Physically I mean.”
“To make it more comfortable for you to interact with me.” Her lack of facial expression was starting to brush on the uncanny valley,  “Most sentients find it easier to interact with other individuals of the same or similar phenotype.”
Marcus nodded at the explanation. It made sense given how humans could hate each other for differences as small as skin color, but that lack of expression was really not helping. “Since you’re here to answer questions, what is the System?”
“The System is the manifestation of a confluence of cosmic laws and an interface to interact with fundamental principles of that confluence,” she replied, her answer raising more questions than it resolved.
“Can you elaborate? What cosmic laws? What fundamental principles?” he pressed.
“No further elaboration available,” She replied after a half second or so, as if querying something. “Relevant knowledge of the System will become available as you progress in the Multiverse.”
That caused Marcus to frown. The System clearly limited information, but on what criteria? Why? He considered trying to rephrase the question and press further, but decided to pursue other inquiries first. “Ok, then what is the Multiverse?” 
“The Multiverse is the set of universes which have evolved sufficient sentient life to be integrated into the System.” Again, her answer sounded like an AI reading from a set of help files.
“How many universes are we talking about?” Marcus wasn’t entirely unfamiliar with some of the multiverse theories of reality, but clearly this wasn’t quite the same thing.
“This integration brings the total number of universes in the System to 20.”
“Only 20? That seems much lower than I expected. Why so few?”
“For the System to integrate a universe, that universe must meet a set of specific criteria. This includes sufficient ambient mana levels in the universe, containing a minimum threshold of universe maturation indicated by the amount of recognizable sentient life contained therein, and a certain degree of cosmological proximity to a universe that is already integrated.” She tilted her head as she regarded him. “While countless universes exist, thus far only 20 universes meet all criteria. This number will increase as each new universe that is fully integrated brings additional candidates into cosmological proximity of the System.”
That made sense… sort of. Clearly the System was spreading from some point of origin in the cosmos. Maybe universes spread out from some central point like galaxies did in their universe? “How long has the System been spreading through the cosmos?”
“Approximately 5 billion local years have elapsed since the System was initiated. System initiation resulted in a waveform that propagated through the cosmos and triggered the processes which resulted in the formation of life in compatible universes.”
Marcus blinked. He vaguely recalled that the Earth itself wasn’t even 5 billion years old yet. And the System was initiated? That implied that it didn’t spontaneously come to exist but was somehow created? “Why was the System initiated?” The question sprang off his tongue before he consciously decided to ask it.
“The System was initiated to ensure that life persists in the Multiverse and to stabilize universes where sapience develops while fostering growth and strengthening individual sentient organisms.”
Interesting. That question seemed to get around the limits on questions about the System. So maybe, “How does the System foster growth and strengthen sentient organisms?”
“The System accomplishes these goals by two means: by promoting and rewarding competition between organisms and by infusing all multicellular life with sufficient mana to make significant growth and development possible. The increased mana levels also stabilize stellar activity and extend biological lifespans.”
That was… a lot to digest. Whatever the System was, it didn’t appear to be bad thing based on these explanations. He did still need some clarifications based on the terminology the system used, “and just what is mana?”
“Mana is the most fundamental form of metaphysical energy. It can be manipulated and altered by both the environment and by life itself. As an organism becomes able to store and concentrate more mana within themselves, they become both more powerful and less susceptible to damage and thereby more likely to continue living. Your planet’s culture had numerous similar notions such as chi or qi, ki, vitae, and prana, though none of those fully encapsulate what mana truly is, as those terms primarily focus on more internalized functions of mana.”
&quot;It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together,” Marcus quoted doing his best Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi impression. 
“Essentially, yes.” The Guide agreed, completely missing the reference.
She had no sooner finished her explanation when she froze and the screen reappeared in front of Marcus.

            <Text>The room Marcus found himself standing in was probably 15 square meters, with the plastered walls in pristine condition and painted with a series of intricate murals that seemed to intend to tell a story. The only exit from the room was sealed archway centered in the wall opposite where he stood. He’d only just managed to orient himself, when a System notification popped up.

Your weapons have been confiscated and your Identify skill has been disabled for this Challenge. They will be returned on completion.
Dungeon Objective: Pass the tests to unlock the Archive (0/5 completed).
Dungeon Objective: Complete the Dungeon within 30 days (29:23:59:59 remaining)

He turned slowly, looking around the room more carefully. Three of the four walls each contained three panels of the mural, with only the wall containing the door differing notably. That wall, had only two panels of the mural, one to each side of the sealed door. Marcus strolled over to the archway, which contained a heavy metal panel that completely blocked the way forward. The front of the panel was engraved with dozens of squares, each square containing a single pictograph. He could feel the mana embedded in each of the pictographs and recognized they comprised some sort of control panel. Quite likely he would need to discern the correct sequence of pictographs to activate to open the door. 
He turned to the mural panel just to the right of the archway, expecting that the murals would hold the clues he needed to figure out the sequence. The first panel depicted a couple surrounding a cradle that held a newborn, so a representation of a birth perhaps? He studied it closer, finding a multitude of tiny details painted into the background. Frowning he tried to understand what he was supposed to see in the mural. He followed the murals clockwise around the room, studying each one in turn. Slowly he put the story together, realizing the tiny details painted into the murals were there to give context and background to the story they told. 
The child had been born into a world ruled by tyrants, where slavery was rampant. While the child had been born free, his home city fell to invaders. He and his people were taken as slaves by the victors. The child grew tall and strong, they were popular with the other slaves and secretly began organizing a rebellion. The rebellion was impressive and widespread, but ultimately futile, being crushed by the tyrants. The final mural showed a new couple, being wed. It was clear that the murals were intended to show a cycle of violent rebellion against injustice that failed each time. 
Marcus went back to the panel and spent even more time studying the pictographs and even the Mana imbued into each pictograph. He couldn’t see a way to relate the abstract symbols to the story in the murals at all. So he made a second circuit of the murals, this time ignoring the story and studying other aspects of the murals. It was only then that he noticed what he had missed on the first pass. The story was a distraction. There were small symbols at the four corners of the frame surrounding the mural. He studied the symbols, only for his Lingual Savant ability to allow him to recognize them as numbers written in a language not native to his old reality. 
As he moved around the 11 panels, he found that there were 11 numbers with each one appearing 4 times spread randomly across the panels. He studied the numbers for a long while comparing them to the control panel. He finally realized that the pictographs were another form of numerical abstraction, one more complicated than the alien script on the mural frames. It took him a while before he found the answer, finding the pattern in the numbers. It was a variant of the Fibonacci sequence that started from a different base pair.
 Once he had the numbers in the right order, he studied the pictographs until he could match one pictograph to each number in the sequence. Then he touched each of the 11 pictographs he’d identified in the correct order. Each pictograph began glowing as he touched it, until finally the door began grinding and lowering itself into the floor after he activated the final pictograph.

Marcus pushed through the archway and followed the narrow hallway on the other side. He studied the strange markings on the walls carefully, unsure of what might be a clue to his next test. At the end of the passageway, he stepped into a well lit library, with two other exits, one of which was sealed off with a short pedestal beside it. On a long table in the center of the room, he found some manner of arcane device which had been disassembled into its component parts and scattered across the table top. He examined the bookshelves, finding a wide selection of texts and treatises focused on topics ranging from the History of the Multiverse to various aspects of Magical Theory. 
He examined the other open doorway to find a small sleeping chamber with an attached bathroom that included a shower. On returning, he examined the pedestal and the sealed door. Marcus realized that the only way to open the path forward was to properly reassemble the device and place it on the pedestal. Only, to do that would require him to understand what the device was and how it worked. His eyes went back to the bookshelves and he suddenly came to understand the reason for the 30 day limit on the dungeon and went to work.
He spent several minutes going over the books on the shelves selecting the volumes he thought would help him with the task at hand. Marcus spent the next several days, studying and taking extensive notes in his research journal as he unraveled precisely what the device was supposed to be, the basic theory behind artifice, and how to reassemble the Mana construct that made up the magical heart of the device. He learned that the device was a Mana resonance key, a sort of skeleton key for magical locks. It was complex and painstakingly precise work to reconstruct and he found himself truly enjoying the challenge. In the end it took him a week to complete the task, but he was also fairly sure he could use his notes to create additional such keys with access to the right materials. 
Placing the key on the pedestal, he smiled widely as the door slid aside and he received the System update.

The door opened into what appeared to be some sort of ritual chamber. The center of the ritual space had a series of intricate, but clearly incomplete interconnected ritual circles laid out on a raised dais. There was no other visible exit from the room. The walls of the room were lined with shelves and boxes containing ritual materials. 
Understanding of the puzzle before him dawned quickly and Marcus moved to examine the circles more closely without disturbing them. He spent the best part of an hour studying the formation and carefully copying each individual circle into his notes, paying special attention to how they were linked together. Once he was satisfied with his work, he stood and returned to the previous room. He put away the research materials he had needed for artifice and began gathering what he needed for this new task. Soon books on ritual magic, magical formations, and more advanced magical theory were scattered over his work area as he began deciphering the working he was meant to complete. 
To his surprise, Marcus discovered he had a very good intuitive grasp of the concepts involved in ritual and formation magic. Within just a few days, he was able to reconstruct the missing pieces and knew how to complete the ritual. It took another two days of meticulous work to draw out and adjust the circles, correcting small mistakes as he went. Finally, after triple checking everything against his notes, he pushed his Mana into the formation and activated it. 
In response, the first circle began to glow, softly at first but growing slowly brighter as it drew in and focused the ambient Mana in the room over several long minutes. Once it accumulated enough power, the next activated and began building up the power it required, repeating the cycle with each of the five circles that made up the formation. Marcus watched carefully, using his Mana senses to watch for instabilities or fluctuations that might disrupt the complex working. Several times he used his skill at manipulating Mana to smooth out the Mana flows or stabilize sections of the formation that wobbled in response to natural shifts in Mana. It took four hours before the final circle was fully charged and the working began in earnest.
Holding the ritual together was like balancing on a razor’s edge in those final moments, but with careful, methodical intent, Marcus let his own Mana, infused with his will, flow into the trigger sequence. Within moments, the Mana contained in the ritual moved. It raced through the carefully laid patterns like a wild river, straining to overflow its banks. The power moved and the world changed as a tear in space began to form over the formation. It swirled and shifted as more and more of the Mana from the formation flowed into it, expanding and stabilizing the tear, transforming it into a proper portal. 
As soon as gate stabilized, Marcus received the next System update and stepped through the portal.

The sensation was decidedly disorienting. His mind swore he had traveled an incomprehensible distance through an eternal moment that did not exist. It left his head spinning dizzily for several moments. When it cleared he looked around to find himself standing on a small platform at the back of what appeared to some manner of laboratory. The worktops were strewn with the all the tools of the apothecary’s trade: mortar and pestles, pipettes, alembics, mixing bowls and cauldrons, herb strippers, and a myriad of other necessities.  The walls were covered with shelves containing jars and vials of ingredients in various states, flower boxes with growing herbs, mushrooms and mosses, and cabinets containing who knew what else. At one workstation, a heavy leather bound book was propped up on a stand beside a half completed concoction of some kind. 
There was a single, open door leading out of the room, which Marcus promptly explored.  The adjoining room contained what appeared to be a research library for alchemy based on the titles he skimmed. Two further doors led out of the library, one leading to what looked like sleeping quarters with an attached restroom, the other opening up to a wide hallway. At the end of the hall stood a pair of heavy bronze doors engraved with the same dragons that appeared on the door to the dungeon. Just before the doors, in the center of the hallway stood a small obsidian pillar with a small basin inset at the top.
Marcus shook his head with a wry smile. At least the tests had been unambiguous about what he needed to do so far. It seemed like this time, he needed to the correct alchemical concoction to progress. Most likely the one described in that open text back in the laboratory which he’d wager he needed to reconstruct from a partial recipe.  Not that he was complaining as the last two challenges had significantly deepened his understanding of all sorts of magic and he was sure this one would further broaden that knowledge base.
He turned back and went to examine the open book in the laboratory. After spending some time reading through the information it held, he took it and retreated to the library for another research deep dive. This particular test looked to be a damn sight more complicated than the last two and he didn’t have time to waste. Thankfully he had always done well in chemistry classes and had all the research materials he could need.

Marcus exhaled slowly as he carefully infused the concoction in his cauldron with his Mana to activate it. It had taken 15 days of trial, error and careful research to reach this point, and it was his third time reaching this point. If he failed again, his attempt was finished as would only barely have enough time for one more attempt which would leave no time for the final test at all. 
Focusing all of his concentration, he infused the Mana as slowly and cautiously as his Mana control skill would allow. He felt the power within the brew gradually approaching critical mass and eased back on the Mana flow even more. He had learned the hard way that too much Mana would make the concoction explode and too little would have it break down into a foul-smelling, useless, black sludge.
The concoction teetered on the brink for a long, incredibly stressful moment before pulsing with power as the liquid absorbed the Mana and activated. Marcus leapt back from the cauldron pumping his hand in triumph and shouting an enthusiastic, “FUCK YEAH!”
After several minutes of jubilant celebration, he pulled himself back together, calmed down and ladled the contents of the cauldron into a set of empty potion vials he’d prepared. Surprisingly he managed 6 doses, which was the maximum amount possible from the recipe. That meant he had finally managed to get everything exactly right, not just close enough to work. 
He put the 5 spare doses in his sling bag and carried the final vial to the basin. The concoction had turned out to be a powerful Mana disruptor, capable of degrading, if not outright destroying, any Mana construct it came in contact with. This particular version was reputed to be so potent that if it were ingested or otherwise introduced to a living body, the damage to internal Mana flows could cause massive damage and render them unable to use Mana of any kind until their pathways healed, which could take weeks or even months.
Marcus carefully uncorked the vial and poured it into the basin, making sure not to let even the tiniest drop get on him. The doors before him glowed a soft blue for several long moments before the glow faded and they swung open silently.

He strode into the final challenge room, ready to face whatever awaited him.

            <Title>Secrets of the Past Final</Title>
            <Text>As he crossed the threshold into the room, two large braziers burst to life with the same blue-green flame he’d encountered outside the dungeon, illuminating the room. Standing before him in the center of the room stood a truly massive sphinx with a woman’s head. It had to be four meters tall at the shoulder, and it was sprawled comfortably on the floor like a gigantic cat. It slowly turned its eyes to Marcus and let a smile spread slowly across its face.
“Well, well, well,” the Sphinx’s voice was a powerful, melodious, alto and was filled with curiosity. “You’ve done well to get this far, little Dragonkin. Its been so long since someone faced me here.” She moved like a cat, stretching languorously and sitting up without her eyes ever moving from his face.
“Ah, I must assume you’re my final test then,” he said with a slow nod. “And I can add ‘Sphinxes’ exist to the list of things I’ve learned since entering this Tutorial.”
She snorted a laugh. “I am indeed, though whether you’ll survive my test, remains to be seen.”
“In my world’s legends, a Sphinx would ask travelers a riddle and devour those who couldn’t answer it correctly,” Marcus turned his attention to the rest of the room as he spoke. “Should I take it those legends weren’t far off the mark?”
“They weren’t far off indeed,” the Sphinx confirmed, her eyes glinting hungrily. “Only it’s three questions, rather than one riddle.”
“Well, I suppose I’ve made it this far,” he replied with a slow nod. “I’m going to assume I pass the final test by getting past you?”
“Indeed, I am the Guardian of the Archive,” the pride was audible in her voice. “I have not been bested in more years than you can count.”
Marcus strolled to one side of the room and made a show of studying the imagery depicted in the frescoes that covered the wall. He spoke again in an offhanded and casual tone. “That long? Well then, I must admire your patience. Are you truly aware of the passage of time in the Multiverse? Or do you only exist while someone is attempting the Dungeon?”
The sphinx sniffed the air and gave him a somewhat puzzled look. “You truly don’t fear me? How interesting.”
“No, I see no reason to fear you. If you choose to eat me, there’s little enough I can do about it. Why fear things beyond your control?” He kept his face to the wall, hiding his grin from the Sphinx.
“How interesting,” she shifted her position, keeping her eyes fixed on him as moved down the wall, continuing to study the artwork, “I’ve never met a creature who didn’t fear their fate if they failed my test. Do you truly not fear death?”
“No. I respect death, I’d be a fool not to,”  he answered with a laugh. “But I’ve faced death many, many times and I see no reason to fear the end of this life. Either I will find my place in whatever comes after and continue, or I will cease to be and never truly be aware I died.” 
He continued to move along the wall before turning to face the back wall of the chamber, where a single sealed gateway stood between him and a hallway scaled for creatures much smaller than the sphinx. “So, are you the arbiter of the test as well as the test? Or does some other magic determine what counts as a correct answer to your questions?”
“The magic of the contract that binds me to guard the archive is the arbiter of your fate,” she replied, smirking at him. “I am but the proctor of the test and the instrument of your demise, should you fail.”
“That makes sense,” he agreed with nod as he paused before the gate and appeared to study it for a long moment. “And I assume a successful completion of the test would end your contract? Freeing you from your obligations?”
“It would indeed,” she agreed. “However, if you think that means I will make this easy for you, you are much mistaken. To intentionally make the test easy for you to pass would be a gross violation of the contract that binds me and the backlash of such a thing would be… unpleasant to say the least.”
“Makes sense,” he nodded, continuing to study the gate. “I don’t suppose there’s a way to pass this test that doesn’t involve besting your questions?”
“If you slew me, or could find a way to open the gate without being eaten,” she shrugged. “Those would technically be ways to pass the test, as you would have gotten past me. The questions are only a means to an end for you after all, as answering my questions will open the gate.”
“Well, that’s thoughtful of whoever set up these tests,” Marcus opened his sling bag and withdrew a second vial of the Mana disruptor, “It’s always nice when their are multiple ways to accomplish the goal. I suppose the more difficult or creative the solution, the better the rewards are likely to be as well?”
“That would be the System’s usual approach to such things,” she shook her head watching him with narrowed eyes. “Should I presume you think you’ve come up with a more creative solution to the test than answering my questions?”
“Oh, at least two solutions that I think are more creative than just straight up playing a game of questions with you, though I suppose how much more creative is a matter of perspective.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the gate barring the hallway vanished and Marcus darted forward as quickly as he could, getting out of the Sphinx’s reach.
“TREACHERY!” the suddenly enraged sphinx screamed trying to pounce at him. She stretched her feline paw as far down the small passageway as she could finding him several feet beyond her grasp. “
“Treachery?” He clasped his hand to his breast. “I’m wounded by the very accusation. You asked three questions and I answered them. That they weren’t the questions you meant to ask is hardly my fault.”
“What?! What three questions?” the sphinx demanded.
“First, you asked ‘You truly don’t fear me?’. You may have intended it rhetorically, but I answered none-the-less. Then you asked ‘Do you truly not fear death?’, which was indisputably a question directly asked and honestly answered. And finally you asked, ‘Should I presume you think you’ve come up with a more creative solution to the test than answering my questions?’, and I also answered that truthfully.” Marcus shrugged. “Since the gate opened when I answered that third question, it would appear the contract agrees with my interpretation and you are now free without backlash.”
The sphinx stared at him for a long moment, clearly taken aback, before narrowing her eyes. “You are dangerously clever, Dragonkin.” 
“And dangerously reckless,” he agreed, “My second plan was a lot more likely to end… less well than this.”
“Second plan?” the sphinx jerked back slightly startled.
“Well, yeah, I mean I told you I had at least two alternatives to playing your game.” Marcus shrugged again. “The other plan was to use my second vial of Mana disruptor from the fourth test to disrupt the gate and then dodge your attempts to kill me if that actually worked since it would take a few seconds and you would probably catch on.”
She blinked at him again, processing his words. “That would have been more dangerous,” she agreed. “Though I also would have enjoyed the attempt more.”
“Yeah, I’d apologize for that, but I’m not actually sorry I didn’t have to try and avoid you swatting me like a mouse.” He smiled. 
“Dangerously clever, indeed,” she shook her head. “If we ever cross paths again, I will be much more careful of you, Dragonkin.” The sphinx spread her wings and bowed slightly to him before vanishing in a swirl of mana.
“So will I,” Marcus agreed quietly, “so will I.”
Then he turned and walked into the archive itself.

            <Title>Convention</Title>
            <Text>Marcus leaned heavily on his cane as he waited for the approaching bus, taking some of the weight off his weaker leg after a long day walking around the convention. His plan for the evening was to grab a bite to eat, head back to his hotel room, play a game for a bit on his laptop to unwind, and get some sleep before the last day of the Con. 
He smiled, half-amused, as he watched a group of Imperial Stormtroopers and Star Trek Red-shirts stage a picture of mock combat in front of the convention center. Of course, the Stormtroopers didn’t hit anything, but the Red-shirts died melodramatically anyway. 
As Marcus turned away, he caught a glimpse of himself in the plexiglass of the bus stop. For a man who just turned 48, and was a bit of a nerd at heart, he decided that he didn’t look too bad. He was tall, broad shouldered with a sturdy blue collar physique; the sort of guy who looked like he took care of himself without going overboard with it. His short, shiny black hair was spattered with silver and flowed back in a well groomed high fade. His mustache and goatee, also liberally streaked with silver, worked well to soften some of the sharper planes of his face and made his Roman nose seem a bit less prominent. Combined with his cargo shorts, boots, gaming tee, and his goth-y, patch-covered, black denim vest with deep inside pockets, he didn’t look at all out of place. Just one more Gen-X gamer at a Con. 
Glancing around as the back of his neck tingled ever so slightly, Marcus grimaced. He was never completely comfortable in crowds, but it was one of the biggest gaming Cons in the country and a great excuse for visiting Las Vegas in April. He’d just needed to get away for a while to clear his head and relax. A week at a Luxury Vegas Hotel topped off with the Con before he went back to North Carolina was a helluva good way to celebrate his birthday. Of course, his business partner had made a crack about it being a waste of a good midlife crisis, but at least he hadn’t dropped a year’s salary on a sports car like Craig had. Spending that kind of money on that kind of conspicuous consumption just seemed wasteful.
Sighing with relief as he heard the city bus coming down the block, Marcus straightened back up, ignoring the low throb from his bum knee and the raised hairs on the back of his neck, and got in line to board the bus. He found himself stuck standing, but at least it wasn’t a long ride to his hotel and he’d make it in plenty of time for his dinner reservation. The person he really felt bad for was the guy in the Wookie costume a few people ahead of him. It’d been sunny and 90 degrees today, and air conditioning could only do so much in a crowded convention center. He honestly didn’t know how the hardcore cosplay crowd managed it, but couldn’t help admiring their resolution to boil inside a full body suit for the sake of the fandom.
Marcus grimaced as the bus turned onto the strip, the swaying of the vehicle shifting more of his weight onto his half-crippled left leg. While pain had been a constant companion for the last 25 years, the time he’d spent on his feet today had pushed his tolerance to the limit. He’d need to add soaking in a hot bath to his plans for the evening. 
As the bus trundled toward the main strip, the crowd began to thin, and Marcus finally folded onto a seat with a sigh of relief. He massaged his aching leg, working to loosen up the cramping muscles in his thigh.
“Not a style choice then?” a cheerful young lady’s voice asked from the row behind him.
Marcus turned to see a pretty girl, probably less than half his age, smiling down at him, dressed as what he could only assume to be an anime character. She’d clearly noticed the Con badge around his neck and felt comfortable talking to a fellow nerd. He grinned wryly as he answered, “Sadly not so much, I managed to break my legs quite badly in my younger days and the cane has been a necessity ever since.” 
“Wow. That must’ve been quite some break. How’d you do it?”
“Jumping out of an airplane,” his grin became much broader at the surprise on her face. “I landed… poorly.”
“Ouch,” she winced sympathetically, before offering Marcus her hand. “I’m Cassie.”
He gave her a hand a gentlemanly shake, “Marcus. You just in town for the Con or are you local?”
“Local, actually. How about you?”
“Oh, I’m just visiting. This trip is my birthday present to myself, I head back out the day after the Con ends.”
She gave him a sly look, and with a smirk said, “What a shame, you seem like you’d be fun to get to know.” 
Marcus was taken aback for a moment. Was she flirting with him? Or was he entirely misreading the situation? They’d barely spoken, and she was clearly significantly younger than he was, but that mischievous expression left him off balance.
“Uh, thanks,” he stammered, uncertain of how to respond. 
“Oh wow,” her grin turned a little more lascivious, “and shy too. Definitely too bad we didn’t run into each other sooner.”
“Uh, yeah,” he could feel his face heating up, “definitely.” Marcus noticed with an odd feeling of relief that his stop was next. “Maybe we’ll meet again another time under… less constrained circumstances.” He had no problem admitting to himself that he was running away. He just wasn’t sure how to handle aggressive women who were barely older than his own daughter. As the bus drew to a stop, he levered himself to his feet, favored the young lady with his best smile, and escaped into the street without perishing from the embarrassment burning in his chest. There was no way she had been flirting with him, right?

            <Title>Group Recruitment</Title>
            <Text>As soon as he began reading the announcement, Marcus’s heart started galloping. The system was practically laying out incentives for groups to hunt one another right alongside the actual objectives. He could only wonder how bad it would get toward the end, when the competition was fiercest. He shot a glance at Cassie, who met his gaze and nodded. 

You have formed a group with Cassandra Blake!

“Do you have a Class or a Profession and what is it?” Cassie asked quickly as she began to look around and see how things were happening as people began scrambling to find groups. 
“Class, Ma.. Call it Caster for now,” Marcus changed his mind mid-word as noticed others were close enough to hear. “We can discuss more specifics when there are less ears. You?”
“Also Class, Striker, if we’re holding cards and waiting for the flop,” Cassie grinned and threw him another wink. “We need someone to tank and a healer right?”
“Ideally,” he agreed with a nod. “Those and one or two more damage dealers and we should be golden.”
“You wanna stay under 10?” she shot him a quick frown. 
“I figure under 10 will be better rewards, six would be good, five would be better.”
“So, we’re playing to win, not just survive?” The corner of her mouth turned up in an evil smile. “I knew I liked you, Daddy! I’ll go talk to a couple of the beastkin, you see if that dwarf over there is game. He looks tanky and us no-longer-humans need to stick together.” 
“On it, you find someone you think will fit, bring them in, don’t wait on a second opinion,” He said as the turned and strode toward the dwarf in question.
“Same goes for you, meet back here shortly,” Cassie turned and flounced off toward the other beastkin she’d talked to.
Marcus sized up the dwarf as he approached them from behihnd. They were maybe 135 cm tall, broad of shoulder and solid looking, wearing what looked like a heavy mail tunic, steel gauntlets, steel spiked boots with a very intimidating axe slung over one shoulder, and a sturdy looking round shield strapped over the other.  As he got within a couple steps of the dwarf, they turned toward him and he almost stumbled. From the back he’d been certain it was a male dwarf he was approaching, but no, it most definitely was not.  
She had clearly seen him stumble. With a mostly-hidden smirk on her lips, and a twinkle in her eye, the dwarf lady asked, “Something I can help you with?” Her voice wasn’t as innuendo laden as Cassie’s had been, but he was pretty sure this was going to be another fine example of him getting teased constantly by a beautiful younger woman. What a world.
“You see the cute fox-girl over there?” he hooked his thumb towards Cassie, who appeared to be in friendly conversation with a humanoid rabbit and an elf. “We’re putting a group together, since the folks who are still factory default humans seem to be avoiding us custom jobs.” He smiled, trying and failing to sound casual. “Thought you might want a shot at being on the winning team. You’re what, a Warrior?”
“Nah, I’m better than any old Warrior, I’m a He…” her voice trailed off at the expression on Marcus’s face. She followed Marcus’s gaze, spotting several nearby humans who were clearly suspicious of them. Marcus relaxed as she seemed to catch on. 
“…a Protector,” she finished, giving him a quick wink. “What about you, hot stuff?”
“Caster,” he lied solemnly, “Cassie over there, the fox-girl, she’s a Striker and is trying to gather us up someone to heal. You interested?”
“Ooo a hot fox-girl AND a cute dragon-man to ogle? Where do I sign up?” the dwarf offered Marcus her hand. “Name’s Freya, yes, for real. Blame my mother.”
“I’m Marcus, welcome to the team, Freya,” he took her hand and was surprised by how soft and warm it was against his more reptilian skin.

Freya Johansen has joined the group!

A few moments later, two more announcements followed. 

India Calhoun has joined the group!
Roberto Guteirrez has joined the group!

It turned out that India was a Rabbitkin ‘Marksman’, while Roberto was an Elven ‘Adept.’ They had known each other before the Integration, which made them a solid two-for-one deal. The five of them gathered in a small group, shying away from the rest of the crowd. 
Once they were pretty sure they weren’t being listened to, Marcus started them off, “Okay, big reveal time. I’m pretty sure, based on Cassie and Freya, that almost all of us who stopped being human got better classes than most. So I’ll start the real meet and greet. I’m Marcus, a Dragonkin-Hybrid and a Magus, which is an Uncommon Caster variant.”
“Oooo, now that is a fancy Class,” Cassie cooed. “I’m Cassie, not Cassandra, never Cassandra,” she introduced herself. “I’m an honest to god Kitsune and a Spellblade which is an Uncommon Striker/Caster hybrid.”
“And I’m pretty sure poor little weebs all over the Tutorial are weeping over missing the chance to group with you,” Freya teased, pulling a giggle out of Cassie. “I’m Freya, yes that’s my real name, and you can blame my mother’s love of mythology. As you can see, I’m a Dwarf and I managed to snag Hearthguard which is a rare, dwarf only Warrior variant.”
“Damn, now I really feel cheated,” Roberto chimed in. “I roll up with all my slick elf charm and all the chulas are busy flirting with each other or the Dragonkin. No matter how I up my game, I’m always a step behind.” He was grinning widely and clearly poking fun without malice. “At least I managed to snag a sweet rare adept variant, called Druid.”
India shook her head melodramatically, “I’m sorry to subject you all to this poor deprived elf… or was the word depraved?” He stuck her tongue out at Roberto who muttered something about promises under his breath. “I am India, a Lepori, and the poor elf’s only friend.” She snickered. “I’m also a Sniper, an uncommon variant of the Marksman.”
“So that’s a tank, in the form of the sexy dwarf lady, a melee dps in the form of the sexy fox-lady, a ranged dps in the form of the sexy rabbit lady, some magical smackdown in the form of a scary dragon-dude and this poor elf to keep you all from dying?” Roberto clarified.
Marcus shook off the moment of surprise brought on by India’s Class, and nodded at Roberto. “That’s what it looks like, unless somebody has another thought?”
“Well, we could pick up a couple more guys,” India suggested. “I mean, I love tacos as much as the next gal, but a little more sausage in the party wouldn’t be a bad thing.”
Marcus winced and started to open his mouth but Cassie jumped in ahead of him. “I don’t think so,” she countered. “See, we don’t just want to survive this Tutorial, we want to win. And since the the score is counted as IP per person, the more people we have the lower our score ends up.” She looked around, “besides I really did not like the looks I was getting from a lot of these guys. I’m pretty sure this competition is going to get real ugly before its over, and more than a few of these guys around here look like no might not be in their vocabulary unless someone is around to make them stop.”
Freya and India instantly lost a good bit of their playfulness and took a closer look at the other people in the room with them. “Yeah,” Freya agreed with a slow nod. “I can kinda see what you mean. If killing isn’t off limits anymore, what’s a little sexual assault.” 
India winced hard, “I can vouch for Roberto, at least, he’s not that kind of guy. Sure he’ll flirt and joke around with you as long as you’ll put up with him, but when you say stop, he stops.” She looked questioningly at Marcus. 
“I’ll vouch for Marcus,” Cassie said immediately. “I’ve practically thrown myself at him a couple times now and he’s never been anything but a sweet, embarrassed, shy gentleman. Besides, if he ever wants a tumble from me all he needs to do is ask… or not tell me no.” 
Freya burst out laughing at the mortified expression on Marcus’s face, “Its so rare to find an actual gentleman in Sin City. I’m pleased to have finally met one.” She inclined her head to Marcus. “I’d make a similar comment to Cassie’s, but seems she’s already called dibs and it’s sisters before misters in my book.” She winked at the fox girl.
Marcus covered his face with both hands. It was going to be a long Tutorial.
“Oh, don’t stop on my account,” Cassie’s grin somehow got wider. “I don’t mind sharing.”
Yep, a very long Tutorial.

Two race levels had doubled his maximum resource pools, though he was still left with his mana pool only half-filled after killing the badger. He had two options as he saw it: he could spend some time meditating to recover his mana more quickly, or he could press on and hope that he didn’t run into anything else that might want to kill him. As the latter seemed unreasonably optimistic, he moved to the base of the tree the badger had been remodeling. It was only as he started climbing up the side of the tree, heading toward a wide branch where he could meditate out of easy reach of the ground, that Marcus realized he’d been moving through the woods barefoot since he climbed the first tree.
When he reached the branch and prepared to begin meditating, Marcus took a few minutes to more carefully examine the bottoms of his feet. To his delight, he found them completely covered in much thicker and more resilient scales than those scattered in patches across the rest of his body. In fact, they seemed every bit as tough as the sole of any shoe he’d ever worn, obviating the need for normal footwear. 
He shook his head with a wry smile. The post-System world seemed intent on making the whole of reality a learning experience where almost nothing could be taken for granted. Since he was going to be resting here for a bit, Marcus decided to check on something he’d been too busy to check before, the pair of leather bound books he’d been given at the end of the Introduction. Slipping off his sling bag, he opened it and withdrew the two books and the quill-like pen stashed within. He identified the pen first as it peaked his curiosity.

Common Mana-fueled Writing Stylus (Tier 1) - One of the most common writing utensils in the Multiverse, this Stylus requires no ink to write. Instead, the user simply infuses a small amount of mana into the device while using it. While charged, the stylus can produce an magical ink that dries instantly on any surface and can become any desired color while writing or drawing. The opposite end of the Stylus can remove the magical ink completely from any surface without damage to the surface in question, making corrections simple. 

Well, that was definitely the most interesting magic writing utensil he had ever encountered and would undoubtedly be extremely useful to any student of magic. Replacing the quill in the bag, Marcus turned his attention to the larger of the two books. 

Uncommon Fundamentals of Magic and Spellcraft (Tier 1) - A highly sought after primer for any who pursue power through the mastery of the Arcane. The knowledge in this book can help expand the reader’s understanding of Magical Theory, Mana Control, and Magical Construct Theory.  

The System had helpfully provided a basic textbook for beginning magic-users, something that was bound to be one of his most useful pieces of starting gear for the longest period of time. The second book turned out to be less interesting, but just as useful. It was blank, being meant for use as a sort of magical research journal during his studies. Storing the books back in his sling bag for now, he turned his mind to the task at hand. 
He composed himself in a basic lotus position and activated his meditation skill. He settled into a smooth and regulated pattern of box breathing as he closed his eyes and turned his focus away from his physical senses. His awareness seemed to settle into the space around him, making him aware of every iota of mana in his surroundings.  Marcus could feel the mana, could see every subtle shift and movement as it coursed through the world around him. He sank ever deeper into the meditation, studying the currents and flows around him intently, until finally his awareness sank into the very core of his own being. 
Here Marcus found a vast well of mana that resided within his own soul, recognizing it as his own Mana core which encompassed his entire Mana pool. He watched as the core filled, his own meditation helping speed the flow of mana into his core to replenish it. He found his senses buffeted by the unruly maelstrom of power within his soul. Felt it as if he were aboard a small raft on the surface of a storm tossed sea. He quickly became aware that his chaotic churn of Mana was slowing his ability to recover his mana. If he could slow the mana within his core down, could move it into a calmer, more harmonious motion, he could not only increase his mana recovery speed, he could likely greatly increase the mana density in his core. 
He took his time, truly studying the flowing and clashing currents of his internal mana pathways. After hours of such study, he began exerting control over his core. He nudged and shifted, pushed and pulled, twisted and shoved the flow of mana within his body and was punished with burning pain each time he overreached his control. Yet as the process continued, his control got stronger and more precise, it became easier to make the adjustments he needed in smooth, painless increments. Finally, everything fell into place and the process began to accelerate, taking on a life of its own. His Mana pool became a vast whirlpool, swirling in unison and pulling down the mana he breathed in from the world around him. From here it was focused and concentrated by the whirlpool as it was pulled into his increasingly dense Mana core at the center of the pool. Then, a steady stream of this denser mana flowed out from his core and through his internal mana pathways. This flow of mana spread through every portion of his body, charging every cell with all the mana it could hold.
As he felt his mana pool reach its current maximum capacity, he knew he was close to something big. Something transformative to his body and soul, a threshold that would mark his first big milestone on his path to power. All he needed was to push just a little more Mana into his core, just enough to edge over the critical mass he needed. It felt like breathing in fire as he over filled his pool little by little, until finally it all collapsed into his core where the mana density had abruptly doubled. It took just a few more hours after that to reach capacity once more and stabilize the core so that emptying it wouldn’t result it having to repeat the compression process all over again. He pulled himself out of his meditation and became aware of a deluge of System notifications awaiting him. 
Marcus focused for a moment filtering out most of the notifications so that he would only see skill evolutions and other critical notifications. Only then did he open his eyes to see what he had really accomplished. 

Congratulations! You have increased your Mana Core compression from Tier 0 to Tier 1!

Congratulations! Mana Control (Class) (Tier 3) has evolved to Mana Control (Class) (Tier 4)! +1 Wisdom point
Congratulations! Meditation (Class) (Tier 2) has evolved to Meditation (Class) (Tier 3)! +1 Willpower point

As he read carefully through the titles and skill evolutions, he found himself somewhat boggled by it all. What he’d done had seemed so obvious given his Class imparted understanding of Magical Theory and his Mana Sensitivity Racial ability. Yet actually accomplishing it had dropped a slew of rewards on him, including removing his need for food and water. Now his body only needed his mana to fuel itself. Marcus had the System bring up just his stats so that he could see the progress.

Vitality:  187/187
Mana: 960/960		Mana Core Compression (Tier 1)
Stamina: 140/140
Soul Strength: 199/199
Free points remaining: 6/16

Strength:	 6	 		Willpower: 17
Agility: 4	  			Intelligence: 12
Dexterity: 10			Wisdom: 23
Endurance: 8			Luck: 19

His mana pool had more than doubled between increases to his Core Compression and his Wisdom, putting him in a much stronger position as a Magus. At least he was much less likely to run short of Mana in a fight. He could only hope that his improved meditation skill was up to the task of keeping his Mana pool topped up without as much need for extended downtime. After all, he’d just spent six full hours sitting here meditating and making other progress and now the Sun was sinking below the horizon.
Marcus took stock of how he felt otherwise. As expected he was neither hungry nor thirsty, but he also felt no particular need to sleep as his meditation had also fully restored his Stamina and Soul Strength, clearing away both his physical and mental fatigue from the days activity. He considered continuing to move through the woods instead of making a camp of sort, but decided against it. Night was likely to bring out a variety of dangerous creatures who nod be even slightly disadvantaged by the lack of light. Without a better idea of what was out there to threaten him, it was a fool’s errand. 
Instead, he settled in to observe the nighttime forest for a while and see what he could learn.

            <Title>Next Choice</Title>
            <Text>Path: Seeker of Power (Uncommon) has reached Tier 1! Automatic stat points allocated.

Marcus felt a pleasantly warm rush after he committed to his Path, feeling his Mana pool expand as the System allocated his tier 1 stat points.  He told the System to bring up his stats to let him verify what had happened.

Vitality:  73/73
Mana: 70/70
Stamina: 60/60
Soul Strength: 97/97
Free points remaining: 10/10

Strength:	 5	 		Willpower: 10
Agility: 4	  			Intelligence: 7
Dexterity: 7			Wisdom: 7
Endurance: 7			Luck: 6

So, his base mana pool was 10 per point of Wisdom, while the other resources must be based on more complex formulae. He held off on allocating any free points until he was more certain of how best to make use of them.
“Congratulations on acquiring your Path,” the Guide said blandly. “Because you were offered and selected an Uncommon path, you may decide if you want to select a Class or a Profession before the tutorial begins.”
“What’s the difference between the two?” he asked immediately.
“Classes tend to be primarily focused on combat oriented skills and abilities, getting far few non-combat skills and abilities,” she answered, “while Professions are primarily focused on non-combat skills and abilities and receive far fewer combat skills and abilities.”
“Is either one inherently superior to the other?” he followed up.
“That is an entirely subjective query with no definitive answer,” the Guide stated flatly.
“Is one or other going to be more useful in the upcoming tutorial?” he tried instead.
“What you choose will determine the type of tutorial you are placed in, which renders this question nonsensical,” the Guide replied, “Only 31 minutes remain in the Introductory period. Please make your choice.”
Well, it seemed like the System wasn’t going to give out any hints in this regard, no matter how he tried to weasel around it. If reality was including game elements like Classes under the System, then it was safe to assume that combat and conflict were very much likely in this new world. Being good at combat seemed more likely to keep him alive long enough to learn a Profession later.
“I will select a Class,” he sighed slightly as he said it. He had expected being discharged from the military would be the end of his days in battle, but clearly the Multiverse had other plans. Immediately, he was confronted with another wall of text on a screen, listing the class options available to him. He started once again from the top.

Warrior (Inferior)(Tier 1) - Warriors concentrate on excelling in close physical combat through the use of armor and weapons, only using ranged weapons for opening strikes or when close combat is inadvisable for some reason. This is a basic starting class.
Primary Stats: Strength, Endurance
Bonus stats per tier:  +1 Strength, +1 Endurance, +1 free point
Initial Class Skills: [Basic Melee Weapon Skill of Choice], [Basic Ranged Weapon Skill of Choice], [Basic Melee Fighting Style of Choice], [Basic Defense skill based on Style Chosen]

That was a very straight-forward class, focused on close combat. While Marcus had studied some martial arts in his youth and had as much hand to hand combat training as any soldier ever got in a modern army, he could hardly be termed an expert melee combatant. 

Striker (Inferior) (Tier 1) -  Strikers concentrate on dealing as much damage to their enemies as they can, sacrificing defense for offense They rely on movement and use light, precise weapons to strike vulnerable points  This is a basic starting class.
Primary Stats: Agility, Dexterity
Bonus Stats per tier: +1 Agility, +1 Dexterity, +1 free point.
Initial Class Skills: [Light Melee Weapon Skill of Choice], Stealth, Sneak Attack, Throwing Blades

Another straight-forward class, akin to the common rogue class in most role-playing games. Great for doing damage, good at avoiding damage altogether, but not so great at soaking it up when they did get hit. Always a popular choice, but it was too early to decide.

Marksman (Inferior) (Tier 1) - Unlike Warriors and Strikers, Marksmen specialize in ranged combat with limited close combat options, However with a defender to stand behind, they thrive, raining powerful attacks down on their foes. This is a basic starting class.
Primary Stats: Dexterity, Agility
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Dexterity, +1 free point
Initial Class Skills: {Ranged Weapon Skill of Choice],  Power Shot, Marksman’s Sight, [Simple Melee Weapon Skill of Choice]

An almost purely ranged character, likely wielding bows or crossbows, he figured, unless some sort of rifle-type weapon was available. A good class as long as you had someone to stand between you and the enemy, or you could kill them before they got to you. Certainly worth considering.

Caster (Inferior) (Tier 1) - A class focused on the use of magic spells, rituals and formations to defeat one’s foes. Often benefits from having time to prepare before a fight. This is a basic starting class.
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Willpower
Bonus Stats per tier: +1 Wisdom, +2 free points
Initial Class Skills: Mana Weapons, Mana Bolt, Mana Barrier, Meditation

The basic class for becoming some manner of wizard. If it played to the archetype, it would start out on the weak side but with the potential to become quite a powerhouse once advanced far enough. Another class Marcus was definitely tempted to take immediately, but  there were still a few options left to consider. He read on.

Healer (Common) (Tier 1) - Healers are a support class focused on keeping teammates alive and providing magical buffs to the people actually doing the fighting. Weak in direct combat, but not helpless. This is a basic starting class.
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Willpower
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Wisdom, +1 Willpower, +2 free points
Initial Class Skills: Mana Weapons, Heal, Mana Shield, Meditation, Healing Theory

In spite of the better rarity, and increased stats and skills, Marcus definitely did not want to be a healer. Tying his advancement to someone else like that was just not an option. He needed to be more self-sufficient than the healer sounded like it was.

Magus (Uncommon) (Tier 1) - Magi are true students of applied magic. Instead of just focusing on rote learning of existing magic like a basic caster, they also study the underlying theories and concepts of magic, making them capable of creating new magic for their own use. This is an advanced starting class only made available by your racial mana sensitivity, your stats and your choice of path.
Primary Stats: Willpower, Intelligence
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Willpower, +2 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom, +3 free points
Initial Class Skills: Mana Weapons, Magical Theory, Mana Control, Mana Bolt, Mana Barrier, Meditation

And a class that was only available because he met some vague special requirements and chose a particular path. It gave more stats and skills than even the healer class and was clearly superior to anything else he’d been offered. Plus, it focused on magic, which definitely suited his personal preferences. It seemed the System liked to save the best for last.
“I choose Magus,” he committed to the class before he could start overthinking his choice.

            <Title>Arrival</Title>
            <Text>The moment the last message appeared everything went black for the barest blink of an eye and suddenly Marcus and his group were standing a huge, primeval forest. The trees towered hundreds of meters tall, with bases that ranged from a maybe half a meter in diameter, up to nearly a dozen meters in diameter. The undergrowth was… patchy for lack of a better word. In some places thick bushes and scrub stood as much as two meters tall, in others it barely reached Freya’s knees or was absent altogether. 
The temperature was comfortable, reminding Marcus of mid-spring in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, an area he loved to visit from his home in Fayettesville. The forest was quiet when they arrived, their sudden appearance probably startling the local wildlife. Marcus closed his eyes and listened hard, looking for the sound of movement nearby or maybe running water if he was lucky.
The rest of the team stood quietly around him, tense as they waited to see what happened next. 

Weekly Tutorial goals duration remaining 06:23:59:59
Kill 100 creatures at least equal to your level. 0/100 complete.
Find and complete your first dungeon. 0/1 complete.
Survive 48 hours without losing a group member. Time remaining to complete: 47:59:59
Earn 100,000 total IP as a group. 500/100,000 complete.
Finish the first week as the top group. Current group ranking: 1st

Marcus opened eyes, having not heard anything nearby. He studied the list of weekly objectives. “Well, it looks we’ve got a bit of a jump on the rest of the tutorial,” he shook his head. “I didn’t hear any water or anything moving. I don’t suppose anyone has some kind of climbing skill?”
The rest of the group shook their heads. “Not surprising I suppose,” Marcus moved to the base of one of the wider trees, bent over and removed his sandals, flexing the talons on his toes and fingers. “Time to see if these talons are useful for climbing then. Spread around this tree and keep a lookout for motion while I climb. Let’s not get distracted and get ambushed if we can avoid it.”
The others nodded and spread around the tree with their backs to the trunk. Marcus leaned his staff against the trunk, placed his hand against the wood and attempted to dig in with his talons. They pierced the bark with just a little effort, allowing him a good hand hold. He began climbing, finding it far easier than he feared it would be. The talons on his toes dug in from his weight and stabilized him easily. It was almost as simple as climbing a ladder.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Climbing (Tier 1) Level 1!

“Well,” Marcus spoke for the benefit of his team. “Now one of us has a climbing skill. I’ll be as quick as I safely can be.” He began scurrying up the side of the tree with the same kind of ease you would expect from a squirrel or a tree lizard. He pushed aside the notifications as his climbing skill improved rapidly, staying focused on moving safely and quickly. Within minutes he was more than 200 meters up, and had disappeared into the canopy. The canopy stretched at least another 80 or 90 meters before the particular tree he was in emerged above the top of the forest canopy. It looked like the bulk of the forest ended around 300 meters up, with only the true titans of the forest extending above that. 
Marcus leaned back a bit, resting his weight surprisingly comfortably on the balls of his feet against the trunk. He looked around cautiously noticing what looked like a large break in the trees some distance off. The area appeared fairly flat based on the uniformity of the forest canopy height. He estimated his height and ran the math in his head to get a rough idea of the distance to the clearance. At roughly 300 meters, the horizon was around 50 or so kilometers… this was maybe a quarter of the way to the horizon he estimated… so 12 or 15 kilometers away. 
He started to climb back down when he heard a commotion on the ground. Without thinking about it, he loosened the talon-grip of his hands and released the tree with his feet altogether, letting his weight drag him down, his finger talons scoring deep grooves in the tree to keep his decent more or less controlled in nature. It wasn’t quiet, but it was definitely much faster than a proper climb would have been. 
When he was a few meters from the ground, Marcus dug both sets of his talons in once more and rapidly slowed to a halt from the extra drag. A quick glance around found his team facing off with what looked like a badger the size of a golden retriever. Freya had it tied up, using her shield to keep it from getting at Roberto who was behind her. Cassie was dancing along the creature’s flanks, peppering it with jabs from her rapier which seemed to be having difficulty penetrating the animal’s hide. Roberto was tossing heals on Freya and Cassie when the beast got stroppy and landed a claw on one of the girls. India was trying to position herself for a clear shot without much success. 
Pulling one hand free from the tree, Marcus activated his Mana Bolt skill and channeled as much Mana into it as it could hold. He had a better angle on the fight than India and aimed the crackling bolt of power at the beast’s head, waiting for the right moment. It came a few moments later, when the beast lunged at Freya only to slam it’s snout into her shield and momentarily daze itself.
Marcus released his spell which blasted across the intervening distance faster than an arrow but slower than a bullet. Thankfully the impact was far more impressive than either. The bolt entered the animal’s skull and blasted straight through into the ground beneath, vaporizing everything in its path.
The badger staggered, wobbling for a few moments before falling over, dead.

Congratulations! You have killed Juvenile Forest Ratel Level 3! Experience awarded! 400 IP awarded for the kill!
Congratulations! Mana Bolt (Tier 1) has improved to Level 2!

“Fuck me,” Freya exclaimed. “If that was just a juvenile, I’d rather not meet an adult for a few levels.”
Marcus descended the last few meters and dropped to the ground as Roberto chimed in, “No doubt. Those claws looked they could rip through metal.” 
“Good work,” Marcus interjected. “You guys had the fight pretty well under control when I got back down here.”
“Fucker’s hide was so thick I don’t think I managed to hurt it at all,” Cassie complained.
“At least you hit it,” India replied with a frown. “The way it was moving I couldn’t line up a shot that wouldn’t risk hitting one of you if I missed.”

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each part of your novel as direct subdocuments of the Manuscript folder. Two  folders have already been created at this level for you, with the placeholder title “Part”. You should rename these with the titles of the parts of your novel.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new folder for each chapter inside the relevant “Part” folder and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folders have been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format

From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose one of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Part titles: Likewise, by default part numbers are added but not their titles. To include the title of a part:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Part Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Part Title” or “Part Title Page”.
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” documents to use your chapter titles and move them so that they are on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folders to the Trash. You should now just have a “Part” folder with your chapter text documents inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 3 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “Level 2 files and deeper” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>Choosing a path to follow</Title>
            <Text>Marcus was confronted with a wall of text on a huge screen. Skimming it, he recognized it as a list of options. He then scanned back to the top and began reading the entries for each Path, giving himself time to decide on which might be a good fit.

Hunter - One of the most basic Paths in the multiverse, the Hunter stalks prey and kills it to acquire what he needs and to protect what is his. This focuses on skills and abilities to navigate unfamiliar areas, identify, stalk and kill prey. Gains bonus experience from tracking and slaying beasts depending on how dangerous the beast is compared to the Hunter. 
Gains 1 Agility, 1 Dexterity, 1 Endurance, 1 Wisdom and 1 free point per tier.
 
Alright, clearly Paths really were very generalized at this point. He couldn’t say that Hunter wasn’t necessarily a good Path for him either. He could definitely think of much worse things to do. He looked to his next option.

Gatherer - One of the most basic Paths in the multiverse, the Gatherer finds and acquires those resources needed to survive or to pursue the various crafting Professions. This focuses on skills and abilities to navigate unfamiliar areas and identify valuables. Gains bonus experience for discoveries and based on the value of resources harvested.
Gains 1 Agility, 1 Endurance, 1 Intelligence, 1 Dexterity and 1 free point per tier.
 
That made sense as the next listed Path. After all, where there are Hunters, there are usually Gatherers, right? It was a less appealing Path for him than Hunter, but not by much. Thankfully, there were still several more options to consider.

Scholar - A slightly more complex Path, the Scholar seeks out knowledge in all its forms wishing to understand the Multiverse in which they live. This focuses on skills and abilities in acquiring and applying knowledge,  Gains bonus experience for discoveries, recovering lost knowledge, acquiring new knowledge, and applying knowledge to create or refine experiments, items, or theories.
Gains 1 Intelligence, 1 Wisdom, 1 Dexterity and 2 free points per tier.

This Path was a small surprise to Marcus, though perhaps he should have expected something like it in retrospect. Knowledge was often regarded as one of the fundamental Paths to acquiring power after all. Especially on Earth, controlling information was, or rather had been, power.

Explorer - Another slightly more complex Path, the explorer too seeks out knowledge: knowledge of new places, of ancient ruins, of lost cultures and people. This focuses on skills and abilities to survive in the wild places of the world and to map out and explore the things you find in those wild places. Gains bonus experience for discoveries and surviving in the wild.
Gains 1 Endurance, 1 Agility, 1 Wisdom, 1 Willpower and 1 free point per tier.

Now that really was appealing. Who in Gen X hadn’t dreamed of being a great explorer when they were a kid? Sadly, Earth hadn’t had many unexplored places remaining, leaving most children to outgrow such dreams. This new world, however, seemed likely to have tremendous amounts of places and information to explore. 

Warrior - The warrior lives and dies pursuing power through conflict and martial might. The world is a dangerous place, and the strong survive. This Path focuses on skills and abilities to improve combat effectiveness and survivability. Gains bonus experience from defeating, subduing or outright killing those who challenge them. 
Gains 1 Strength, 1 Agility, 1 Dexterity, 1 Endurance and 1 free point per tier. 

Marcus was getting into what he tended to think of as adventurer archetypes, which he had definitely been expecting, given the nature of the System so far. The Warrior was the most basic combatant type in most role-playing games, and for good reasons.

Magus - The Magus pursues knowledge of and expertise in magic itself, seeking a measure of power to exert their will over reality itself through spells and rituals. This Path focuses on skills and abilities related to understanding and using the theories, concepts and control over mana and its various physical expressions. Gains bonus experience for studying and using various forms of magic.
Gains 1 Intelligence, 1 Wisdom, 1 Willpower and 2 free points per tier. 

There was the magic-user archetype, which Marcus always tended to prefer in games. This Path represented the wizard in his tower studying magic. But was it really the best choice when one currently knew fuck all about real magic? That remained to be seen, he supposed. 

Adept - The Adept focuses on the more spiritual side of magic in the same way that the magus focuses on the fundamental nature of it. This focuses on skills and abilities related to how willpower and belief influence magic. Gains bonus experience for exploring these aspects of magic and using the resulting spells and abilities to deepen their spiritual understanding of reality.
Gains 1 Wisdom, 1 Willpower, and 3 free points per tier.

This one was the magic-is-religion-or-philosophy Path, which Marcus ruled right out. He followed his own moral compass and had no patience for anyone else trying to impose their social norms on him. He certainly wasn’t about to start proselytizing to others. Fuck that.

Protector - The Protector will do whatever it takes to keep what matters to them safe, whether that means fighting and killing or talking and negotiating doesn’t really matter. This focuses on skills and abilities to defend yourself and others as well as fight back when needed. Gains bonus experience for pursuing knowledge and skills to improve his ability to protect as well as from defeating those who would harm what they protect.
Gains 1 Wisdom, 1 Strength, 1 Endurance, and 2 free points per tier.

Marcus stopped. He took several minutes to really ponder this one. It was clearly aimed at those who spent their life standing up for others and keeping people safe. It appealed to him, as it tapped into the same motivations that had driven him to join the Army and become a soldier. However, he wasn’t sure he was still that man. Age and cynicism had long since rubbed the shine off of his days in the service. He pitied his younger self, who trusted other people to wield him like a weapon for the so-called “greater good.” At least this Path let him decide the best way to do what he felt was needed. But there was one last option to consider before he made up his mind.

Seeker of Power (Uncommon) - Some Paths are defined less by how they do things than by what it is that they ultimately do. Such is the case with this Path, which is dedicated entirely to the pursuit of advancement and power through any means available. The Seeker of Power is not without his own morals or ethics, but cares little for the limits others would impose on their Path. One part Explorer, one part Magus, one part Adept and one part Warrior, the Seeker of Power does not consider any opinion but their own about what is permissible in their pursuit of the pinnacle.
Gains 1 Intelligence, 1 Wisdom, and 5 free point per tier.

Marcus read the final Path over twice before it fully registered. The uncommon tag told him that this was not a Path just anyone could walk, which he had to admit made it more tempting. It was a bit of a jack-of-all-trades Path, for a person who sought advancement and power almost anywhere they could find it, letting only their own morals decide the lines they wouldn’t cross. 
Everything he had discovered about the System so far told him this new world was going to be hard in ways the old world never had been. If it truly was mimicking aspects of the role-playing games he had loved, then conflict and strife were bound to be commonplace. Humans tended to go all Lord of the Flies when there wasn’t someone around to enforce some level of decency on them, and he didn’t think changing into lizard-people would make a difference. If he wanted to survive and actually be able to take care of the people he cared about, could he afford not to pursue power at any cost?
“I choose the Path Seeker of Power,” he said firmly.
