            <Text>Marcus Dragunov
48 • Fayetteville Area, North Carolina
Role in Story: Protagonist
Goal: Initially to survive and protect the people important to him, goals evolve from there.
Physical Description: Six feet tall, solidly built. Left leg is partially crippled from an accident so he relies on a cane to assist with walking, but fairly healthy and fit otherwise. Short, well kept black hair that has gone significantly silver. Well trimmed mustache and goatee also silvered. Heavily tattooed, wears a number of silver stainless steel rings on each hand along with a number of bracelets of leather braid or stainless steel. Dresses in a utilitarian manner, cargo pants/shorts, tee-shirts, boots. Usually with a sleeveless vest with deep inside pockets over the shirt. When working tends toward either an off-the-shelf business suit with practical shoes for dealing with corporate types, or cargo pants, boots, and polos for less formal work. Still carries obvious traces of a military bearing. Steel grey eyes frequently behind plain sunglasses. Fair skinned, with a roman nose and a sharply planed face. Tends to speak quietly, calmly, with a deep baritone voice.
Personality: Fiercely protective of what he cares about, cynical with a gallows wit, a violent temper that is not easy to provoke, clearheaded and accustomed to coping with crises. Pressure tends to focus him rather than frazzle him. Very Gen-X American, so he either cares a great deal about something or not at all, with little in-between. Struggles with cPTSD and some mild paranoia.
Occupation: Former Military Sniper turned Security Consultant
Habits/Mannerisms: Tends toward hypervigilance. Won’t sit with his back to doors or with someone in a seat directly behind him. Tends to deploy long, uncomfortable silences when thinking or when trying to provoke.  
Background: 
		Only child of an Army Combat Arms Officer and a Civilian Nurse who worked in military hospitals, grew up living a fairly nomadic life. Learned to be self-contained at a young age which turned into becoming self-motivated as he matured. Classic gifted kid school experience, with almost all of his social bonding occurring within gifted classes. Parents were somewhat distant and career focused. Father was a strict disciplinarian bordering on abusive. Mother worked long hours (to avoid his father mainly) and eventually divorced his father while he was deployed when Marcus was in his teens. Lived with mother from the divorce until he graduated high school and visits with his father were infrequent during that time due to his military career. Floundered with what to do with his life until he went on a road trip with his father to celebrate his graduation. They talked a lot, in a much more man-to-man way then they had ever been able to before and Marcus learned that he had a great deal in common with his father, including how he was raised and mistakes that his father made in his marriage and family life. The end result was Marcus enlisting in the Army a few weeks after he returned from his trip.
		Marcus enlisted for a military intelligence analyst role but during basic was discovered to have an exceptional knack for shooting. He was subsequently convinced by his training instructors to switch to a combat role where he trained extensively and excelled, completing the US Army Sniper Course with top marks among other training. He served honorably in a number of military actions over a couple of enlistments as a Sniper until an unlucky parachute landing during an insertion wrecked his left knee. His squad had to scrub the mission and drag him to an emergency extraction. He spent two years going through reconstructive surgeries and rehabilitation before being honorably discharged for medical reasons. 
		After his discharge, Marcus acquired a degree in business management with a minor in psychology before starting up a security consultancy group with a former Army buddy who separated. Combining his military and business background the group became successful enough that he was quite financially stable. 
		Socially, Marcus established a small circle of friends, spending a great deal of his downtime, both in and out of the military, indulging in both online and tabletop roleplaying games. While in college he met his first wife, a relationship that produced a single child and a mostly amicable divorce as he managed to not repeat his father’s (and grandfather’s) mistakes, instead making entirely new ones. He has a pretty good relationship with his child, and is able to interact politely with his ex-wife. These days, he splits his time between work, his gaming habits, and maintaining a good level of physical fitness to keep up appearances for work (people rarely like to engage security consultants who appear out of shape or lazy) and to minimize the issues created by his injury as he gets older. 		
Internal Conflicts: Marcus has difficulties with some of the things he did during his time in the service. He is disillusioned with his home country, his role in private security, capitalism, and life in general. He’s been struggling for sometime now and has been entertaining selling his interest in his security group and looking for something else in his life for some time now.
External Conflicts: In the beginning Marcus’s main external conflict is his partner in his security group not wanting him to leave the group and his general sense of ennui. Once the system integration begins, it becomes adapting to and surviving in a world that is suddenly far more dangerous than before.

            <Text>Marcus slept like the dead. He didn’t even stir until the System, in the guise of his Guide, intervened to wake him. 
He suddenly felt ice cold water splash down over his face and tors0. He bolted upright, abruptly fully awake and gasping for air. “OH HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK?!”
“You have been asleep for more than 26 hours as a result of extreme mental exhaustion,” the Guide explained curtly. “You have slept through a twelve and a half hour rest period, a ten hour training cycle, and most of a second, three hour rest period.” The Guide offered him a towel they conjured from nowhere. “The System deemed waking you preferable to allowing you to miss the second ten hour training cycle and having you be disadvantaged in the tutorial.”
He sheepishly reached out for the towel and begin drying himself off. “Oh. Uh. Thanks, then. I guess I sort of overdid it in that last evaluation.”
“Indeed you did,” she confirmed. “You still have pending notifications even before we get started on your inevitable questions about what you accomplished.”
He winced slightly, embarrassed at the realization he really had passed out. “Uh, let me check those then, and pull up my status. My last few moments of consciousness are pretty… vague.”

Final Evaluation complete!
Tallying results…
Congratulations! You have performed in the top 5% of sapients in this universe!
You have earned the title ‘Elite (Universal)’. Title grants access to improved paths during path selection!
Congratulations! You are both a Universe level Elite and have completed a greater feat of renown!
Your title ‘Elite (Universal)’ has been upgraded to ‘Renowned Elite (Universal)(Tier 3)’. You will be able to select both an improved class and an improved profession during path selection as well as receiving an epic upgrade token at the start of the tutorial!

“Oh, uh wow. That seems really good… but what the hell is a feat of renown?” he asked. 
“Feats of renown are what happens when you force the System to do something that should be, well, impossible or nearly so. They come in three tiers: Lesser, Standard, and Greater.” She explained. “When you both forced the System to acknowledge your will was greater than the will being used to control the sphere and then completely shut out all the pain from the backlash that created, you performed a tier 3 feat of renown by pushing your Pain Resistance from tier 1 to tier 6 instantly.”
“OH! That’s how that happened. I thought I saw that before I passed out.” He nodded thoughtfully.
“It stands to be noted that your skill only stopped at tier 6 because that was the force of will you pitted yourself against, because the System cannot express a will higher than tier 6 during an ongoing integration.” The Guide shook their head as if exasperated. “You defeated a will five tiers higher than you, it should have squashed you like a bug.”
“What can I say? I’m a bit stubborn,” he shrugged.
“A bit stubborn,” the Guide scoffed, “That’s like saying the surface of a star is a little hot.”
Marcus chuckled and brought up his full status screen to see the overall what this last evaluation had done to him.

Yeah, that was a lot. And he was only in the top 5% of the new universe? He wondered what the top 1% looked like and if any of them were on Earth. “I don’t suppose you can tell me if anybody else on Earth is doing as well as I have.”
“I cannot. However, it would be the height of arrogance to assume that no others exist with a similar level of talent, albeit in other areas,” the Guide warned. 
Marcus nodded. He hadn’t been considered particularly exceptional on Earth before the System, just another medically retired veteran with a bum leg, a college degree and a small business. He hadn’t precisely squandered his life, but he’d certainly not done anything fantastic or even particularly noteworthy. Maybe he could do something more with what was left of his life. Which begged another question…
“So, you said something before about increased mana levels extending biological lifespans, right?” he asked.
“That is correct,” she confirmed.
“So what does that mean for a human being?” 
“The maximum human lifespan possible before integration was approximately 120 years with a variance of plus or minus 5 years,” she began explaining. “That was, of course, barring injury or disease and assuming that the human had adequate access to food and water. After integration, disease is no longer an issue and non-fatal injuries will eventually fully heal even without medical or magical intervention. Therefore, a tier 0 human, one that did not adapt properly to mana at all, will live for 115 to 125 years barring violence or accident. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of aging will accrue more slowly than before integration as well, leaving them productive and healthy for the bulk of that time.”
“Wow, that’s pretty fucking impressive,” Marcus was surprised by just how much of an effect the System would have, since the average human lifespan of his former reality was about two-thirds of that. 
“Mana adaptation will extend that lifespan significantly.” The Guide continued as if he hadn’t said anything. “A tier 1 human will live twice that long, a tier 2 approximately four times as long, a tier 3 about 8 times as long and so forth.  It is a geometric progression as one increases in power.”
“Wait, so I should live between 230 and 250 years?” He knew he was staring slack-jawed at his Guide but couldn’t help himself.
“No. Your effective tier is increased by your mana core compression tier as you have a higher mana concentration in your body, and you aren’t human.”
He blinked hard as that fact sank in. “So whats the tier 0 lifespan of a Dragonkin-Hybrid?”
“Between 190 and 210 years,” she replied, “which is a significant reduction from the 45o to 550 year lifespan of a pure Dragonkin.”
“So I’m effectively… tier 3? And will live between 1520 and 1680 years?!” He felt lightheaded at the thought. 
“Assuming you stop progressing in power at this point and nothing kills you, yes,” she confirmed. “However, there is also a maximum limit to mortal power and therefore mortal lifespan. That limit is tier 9, which would equate to a lifespan measured in 10’s of thousands of years for you.”
“So no race can advance beyond tier 9?” he asked, finally beginning to grasp just how far away the finish line really was.
“No, anyone who advances their race beyond tier 9, simply ceases to be mortal,” she clarified.
“So, at tier 10 we become immortal? Like truly immortal? Can’t be killed? By anything?”
“No. At tier 10 you become a god, and even gods can be killed; however, killing a god is difficult even for other gods and nearly impossible for a mortal.”
“Wait… so gods are real?” 
“Yes, for at least the last five billion years or so,” the Guide smiled. “The System is unaware of any gods that predate System initiation and many of your world’s mythological creatures and deities are echoes of actual beings from one of the other 19 universes that were integrated into the Multiverse.”
“But there are no gods in this universe?” he asked, mind racing. 
“No,” she replied. “It usually takes a considerable length of time for a god to emerge from a newly integrated universe, and it will be some time before gods from other universes can enter this universe.”
“Oh. Well that’s… good,” he said faintly. “Are there a lot of gods?” 
“That depends on what one considers ‘a lot’. Are there thousands of gods? Absolutely. Millions? Certainly. Billions? Probably. Trillions? Quite possibly. However, their are uncounted trillions of sapients in this universe alone, and trillions more are born every moment of every day across the entire Multiverse.” She explained this patiently, as if understanding that it would be difficult for a mortal to truly grasp the vastness of the Multiverse. “Potential gods are being born every moment. However, not every sapient being can reach godhood, and even those who have the potential aren’t guaranteed to live up to that potential. Most who seek to become gods fail. And even gods can die.”
“So there are more gods than can be conveniently counted, but very few mortals can become gods and most of those die trying and even succeeding doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily be around forever.” He nodded as he let that settle into his mind. “So how can someone tell if they have the potential to go all the way?”
“They can’t. That’s part of why the System encourages competition and growth. To help sapient creatures fulfill their potential. Most will reach a point where they simply can no longer advance on their path, they will stagnate, grow old and eventually die. Others will ascend to godhood and still find a point where their power stops growing. And a precious few will reach the pinnacle of power and look beyond even what the gods can see. The path to godhood can take thousands upon thousands of years. The path to the pinnacle would take millions of years more.”
Marcus closed his eyes. He had never been an truly ambitious man before the System. The only time he had ever even been particularly competitive was during his time as a soldier, when he’d lived on adrenaline and pushing his abilities to their limits. Now, however… Now he needed power so that he could protect the people he cared about. Now he couldn’t afford to be anything but driven to succeed. The way he had been during sniper training. The way he had been when he on a mission. The way he always was when everything was on the line. Because, ultimately, everything that mattered to him WAS on the line now.
He needed to become a god. </Text>

            <Title>Bad Business</Title>
            <Text>Marcus smiled and stretched a bit as he stood up. Dinner had been excellent, well worth both the time and money spent. [After a couple of beers with the meal], he felt relaxed and refreshed as he made his way toward the closest elevator. That feeling lasted right up until Dennis Leary began singing ‘I’m an asshole’ from the phone in his pocket, which tossed his relaxation out the window. He only had one person who’d been set to that ring tone for his trip, and he was sure that he would not enjoy this phone call.
Fishing out his phone, he injected forced cheerfulness into his deep baritone, “Craig, this better be an actual, honest to god emergency or I’m going to key your Porsche when I get back.”
“Damn it, Marcus, that’s not funny! When were you going to tell me that Jimmy offered to buy you out? I thought we were in this together?” 
“We were. Actually still are since I haven’t made a decision yet one way or the other,” he answered, “but if you try to say you’re surprised I’m considering it then you’ve been lying to yourself. You know damn well that my heart hasn’t been in it for a while now.”
“I thought that was the point of this whole vacation thing?” Craig countered, “You spend a week in Vegas followed by a week on a Cruise ship, you clear your head and get back in the game.”
“Or I spend those two weeks clearing my head and decide that what’s best for the business is selling my half to Jimmy and riding off into the sunset,” Marcus shot back. “Either way it’s win-win for you cause you’ll either get a motivated partner back in two weeks, or a partner who’s transitioning out to let someone who cares take over.”
“Oh, stow that bullshit. You know Jimmy’s dead weight when it comes to dealing with clients. On his best days he’s half the closer you are on your worst days.”
“Then find somebody else to offer me more than Jimmy did,” he retorted. “I’m tired, Craig. The world is turning to shit around us and I’m just done pretending to care about things that have stopped mattering to me. I’ll send you a copy of Jimmy’s offer, but if you or someone else doesn’t make a better offer than it than I’m making no promises. And if you call me again before I get back, I’ll accept Jimmy’s offer on the spot and you can fucking deal with it. I’m done talking about this.”
Marcus hung up the phone and struggled for a brief moment with the urge to fling it across the hotel concourse. He breathed deeply, focusing on letting go of his frustration. Once upon a time, he and Craig had been equally invested in the security consulting group they’d set up, but they’d ultimately had different standards for constituted success. Craig had always wanted more: more money, more clients, more renown. Marcus, on the other hand, had wanted a life. He wanted enough money to live well, but didn’t need to live extravagantly. He didn’t need a Porsche and a McMansion, didn’t need the newest latest best in everything, didn’t need bespoke suits and a millionaire life. 
Of course, Craig’s marriage had ended in divorce specifically because he wasn’t providing those things to his wife, so maybe Marcus could understand some of the drive there. Since the divorce, however, Craig had been impossible. The job had become his entire life and he spent way too much time listening to podcasts and streams from big shot tech-bros and venture capitalist types. Suddenly his business partner thought they both needed to work  12 hour days 6 days a week to turn their enterprise into something “real.” Marcus thought that was overkill. They didn’t need to be the next Amazon or Google or whatever. There was no way their security consulting group was ever going to be a Fortune 500 company. It just wasn’t realistic.
Letting out a final deep breath that totally wasn’t a sigh, Marcus made up his mind. If Craig wanted to take a small, regional company like theirs and make them some giant national or even multinational concern, he could do it without Marcus. He turned back to his phone, typed up a quick email, attached a copy of the offer Jimmy had made for his interest in the group. 
He sent the email and felt a weight lift off his chest, felt himself melt back into a calm state of mind. [It was the right choice, for him and all he needed to worry about was him and his almost adult daughter.] Craig could figure his own shit out.</Text>

            <Title>Convention</Title>
            <Text>Marcus leaned heavily on his cane as he waited for the approaching bus, taking some of the weight off his weaker leg after a long day walking around the convention. His plan for the evening was to grab a bite to eat, head back to his hotel room, play a game for a bit on his laptop to unwind, and get some sleep before the last day of the Con. 
He smiled, half-amused, as he watched a group of Imperial Stormtroopers and Star Trek Red-shirts stage a picture of mock combat in front of the convention center. He caught a glimpse of himself in the plexiglass of the bus stop. For a man who just turned 48, and a bit of a nerd at heart, he didn’t look too bad. He was tall, broad shouldered with a good blue collar physique; the sort of guy who looked like he took care of himself without going overboard with it. His short, shiny black hair was spattered with silver and flowed back in a well groomed high fade. His mustache and goatee, also liberally streaked with silver, worked well to soften some of the sharper planes of his face and made his Roman nose seem a bit less prominent. Combined with his cargo shorts, boots, gaming tee, and his goth-y, patch-covered, black denim vest with deep inside pockets, he didn’t look at all out of place. Just one more Gen-X gamer at a Con. 
Glancing around as the back of his neck tingled ever so slightly, Marcus grimaced. He was never completely comfortable in crowds, but it was one of the biggest gaming Cons in the country and a great excuse for visiting Las Vegas in April. He’d just needed to get away for a while to clear his head and relax. A week at a Luxury Vegas Hotel topped off with the Con before he went back to North Carolina was a helluva good way to celebrate his birthday. Of course, his business partner had made a crack about it being a waste of a good midlife crisis, but at least he hadn’t dropped a year’s salary on a sports car like Craig had. Spending that kind of money on that kind of conspicuous consumption just seemed wasteful.
Sighing with relief as heard the city bus turn up [the block from him], Marcus straightened back up, ignoring the low throb from his bum knee, and got in line to board the bus. He found himself stuck standing, but at least it wasn’t a long ride to his hotel and he’d make it in plenty of time for his dinner reservation. The person he really felt bad for was the guy in the Wookie costume a few people ahead of him. It’d been sunny and 90 degrees today, and air conditioning could only do so much in a crowded convention center. He honestly didn’t know how the hardcore cosplay crowd managed it, but couldn’t help admiring their dedication to the craft. 
Marcus grimaced as the bus turned onto the strip, the swaying of the vehicle shifting more of his weight onto his left leg, [the one that had never fully recovered from the injury that ended his military career]. While pain had been a constant companion for the last 25 years, the time he’d spent on his feet today had pushed his tolerance to the limit. He’d need to add soaking in a hot bath to his plans for the evening. 
As the bus trundled toward the main strip, the crowd began to thin, and Marcus finally folded onto a seat with a sigh of relief. He massaged his aching leg, working to loosen up the tight muscles in his thigh.
“Not a style choice then?” a cheerful young lady’s voice asked from the row behind him.
Marcus turned to see a pretty girl, probably less than half his age, smiling down at him, dressed as what he could only assume to be an anime character. She’d clearly noticed the Con badge around his neck and felt comfortable talking to a fellow nerd. He grinned wryly as he answered, “Sadly not so much, I managed to break my legs quite badly in my younger days and the cane has been a necessity ever since.” 
“Wow. That must’ve been quite some break, how’d you do it?”
“Jumping out of an airplane,” his grin became much broader at the surprise on her face. “I landed… poorly.”
“Ouch,” she winced sympathetically, before offering Marcus her hand. “I’m Cassie.”
He gave her a hand a gentlemanly shake, “Marcus. You just in town for the Con or are you local?”
“Local, actually. How about you?”
“Oh, I’m just visiting. This trip is my birthday present to myself, I head back out the day after the Con ends.”
She gave him a sly look, “What a shame, you seem like you’d be fun to get to know.” 
Marcus was taken aback for a moment. Was she flirting with him? Or was he entirely misreading the situation. They’d barely spoken, and she was clearly so much younger than he was, but that mischievous expression left him off balance.
“Uh, thanks,” he stammered, uncertain of how to respond. 
“Oh wow,” her grin turned a little more lascivious, “and shy too. Definitely too bad we didn’t run into each other sooner.”
“Uh, yeah,” he could feel his face heating up, “definitely.” Marcus noticed with an odd feeling of relief that his stop was next. “Maybe we’ll meet again another time under… less constrained circumstances.” He had no problem admitting to himself that he was running away. He just wasn’t sure how to handle aggressive women who were barely older than his own daughter.

Marcus grimaced as the bus turned onto the strip, the swaying of the vehicle shifting more of his weight onto his left leg, [the one that had never fully recovered from the injury that ended his military career]. While pain had been a constant companion for the last 25 years, the time he’d spent on his feet today had pushed his tolerance to the limit. He’d need to add soaking in a hot bath to his plans for the evening. 
As the bus trundled toward the main strip, the crowd began to thin, and Marcus finally folded onto a seat with a sigh of relief. He massaged his aching leg, working to loosen up the tight muscles in his thigh.
“Not a style choice then?” a cheerful young lady’s voice asked from the row behind him.
Marcus turned to see a pretty girl, probably less than half his age, smiling down at him, dressed as what he could only assume to be an anime character. She’d clearly noticed the Con badge around his neck and felt comfortable talking to a fellow nerd. He grinned wryly as he answered, “Sadly not so much, I managed to break my legs quite badly in my younger days and the cane has been a necessity ever since.” 
“Wow. That must’ve been quite some break, how’d you do it?”
“Jumping out of an airplane,” his grin became much broader at the surprise on her face. “I landed… poorly.”
“Ouch,” she winced sympathetically, before offering Marcus her hand. “I’m Cassie.”
He gave her a hand a gentlemanly shake, “Marcus. You just in town for the Con or are you local?”
“Local, actually. How about you?”
“Oh, I’m just visiting. This trip is my birthday present to myself, I head back out the day after the Con ends.”
She gave him a sly look, “What a shame, you seem like you’d be fun to get to know.” 
Marcus was taken aback for a moment. Was she flirting with him? Or was he entirely misreading the situation. They’d barely spoken, and she was clearly so much younger than he was, but that mischievous expression left him off balance.
“Uh, thanks,” he stammered, uncertain of how to respond. 
“Oh wow,” her grin turned a little more lascivious, “and shy too. Definitely too bad we didn’t run into each other sooner.”
“Uh, yeah,” he could feel his face heating up, “definitely.” Marcus noticed with an odd feeling of relief that his stop was next. “Maybe we’ll meet again another time under… less constrained circumstances.” He had no problem admitting to himself that he was running away. He just wasn’t sure how to handle aggressive women who were barely older than his own daughter.

            <Title>Prodigious Prodigy</Title>
            <Text>Marcus swallowed hard on seeing the System message about his Mana Control skill. Apparently the better you were at something in the System, the harder you got pushed to excel. Now he could only hope he could rise to the challenge. He concentrated, focusing his entire attention on the task at hand and shutting away everything else. The mana density in the room with him was skyrocketing, increasing an order of magnitude more quickly than it had in previous evaluations. It took everything he had learned, everything he had accomplished so far, to keep up with purifying, circulating and condensing the mana into his core. 
Within what felt like mere minutes he was at the limit of what his existing pathways could handle and he felt them starting to break down. He needed better methods and more robust pathways if he was going to keep up. He needed another breakthrough in his understanding of mana, he needed something more than what he had been taught. He shut out the pain as he fell behind and the impure mana grated against his pathways and strained his core. Pain, after all, had been a constant companion of his for decades. It was practically an old friend.
Mentally, he stepped back. Expanding his mana senses to see the whole picture of how he was handling the mana around him. He slowed his breathing, buying himself more time to find a solution before his current mana system would breakdown. Observe. Understand. Act. It was the most basic core principle he had ever relied on. Observe what is going on. Pay attention to every detail, no matter how minor. Keep observing until you see both the  patterns and the deviations from the pattern. Then you can understand. You can start to follow the causality, the cascade of effects resulting from both adhering to the pattern and deviating from it. Only after you understand can you act without adding chaos to the system. And you should never add unwanted chaos to an otherwise stable system.
He focused intently, studying the flow of mana and seeing the flaws, even ignoring the System notifications he felt accumulating. [The mana flow was slowing down, backing up. The unmoving mana that made up his core was bogging the whole system down, stealing the momentum of the mana flow. But how to fix that when it took time to compress the incoming mana into the core itself.] He considered the problem for just a few moments before inspiration hit him. He reached into the mana at his core, and twisted, turning the mana. He focused and pictured a stick stirring the mana until it started moving. The he pushed it rotate faster, in a tighter circle before slightly altering the pathways into and out of his core. Now the faster moving, more dense mana coming into his system would maintain the rotation perpetually and the mana exiting would exit with the force of the rotation speeding it along. 
Instantly the pain and pressure on his internal mana pathways began to ease, even as he continued to watch it closely and observe the effects of the change. To his surprise, the denser the mana around him became, the faster the entire system moved, fueled by increased incoming energy. Even more interesting was the fact that the mana rotating in his core was acting like a centrifuge, separating even more of affinities and impurities from the incoming mana and siphoning those unwanted parts into the outflow. More and more mana of ever greater purity and higher density was being pulled into his core this way. In fact, he felt himself nearing the threshold of a second compression. It just needed a little push and…
Abruptly the mana in the deepest part of his core collapsed inward like dying star and the rush of mana to fill the void thus created almost disrupted his entire flow. Gritting his teeth tightly, he pushed through the pain, once more reaching into his core and pushing the mana into motion, stabilizing and accelerating the rotation once again. It was an intensely unpleasant process as mana that [hadn’t been purified enough rushed into his core to fill the void and only as he finally got it back up to speed and expelling unwanted affinities did the pain finally start to lessen.] When his core fully stabilized at it’s new level of compression the pain vanished and he began to breath easier, relaxing. 
Finally he turned to his accumulated System messages, scrolling through the list on his screen to the bottom and most important notifications. And there were a lot of them

Current Cycle Duration remaining 0:12:09

Wow. That was… a thing. An evolved skill, one upgraded title and three new titles, all from solving one problem he only found because the System decided to crank up the difficulty of his evaluation. Not that he was going to argue, it felt damn good. Apparently he had a natural talent for controlling mana, who’d have thunk it? He also had to admit that seeing concrete evidence for how good he was at something and how those skills improved was a hell of a motivator. It felt awesome watching the numbers go up.
Of course, the experience was revealing in a bunch of other ways too, as he had a ton of new questions for his Guide. [Did he have some kind of status screen where he could see his stats, skills and titles?] What were classes? Okay, he had a pretty good idea what classes probably were, but he wanted confirmation. How did he get a class? How did he get more skills? Would any of his pre-System skills be recognized by the System? How could he learn more about using his mana? Did the existence of mana imply the existence of magic? There was just a lot he didn’t know. Yet.
Marcus resumed his deep breathing, this time to calm his excitement instead of the mana raging through him. It seemed increasingly like the arrival of the System in their universe was about to dump them into a reality that bore a strong resemblance to the video and tabletop roleplaying games he’d always loved. That had a lot of troubling implications when he thought about it. Those kinds of game worlds were rarely safe or tranquil. Is that what the System meant by promoting competition between organisms? And rewarding them by letting them see their improvement in the things they did and even granting titles when they do something truly impressive? 
It would definitely light a fire under some to explore everything the system had to offer and improve themselves. He knew that his people, his friends, his daughter, his brother and sister-in-law and their family, would probably be fine. All of them were gamers of one sort or another and had the innate gamer addiction to the dopamine hits from watching numbers go up. Hell they probably wouldn’t just be fine, they’d probably thrive. Other folks though? There would be a lot of people who would struggle in such a radically changed world. In fact, he’d wager that human society as it was died the day the System came to Earth.

            <Title>Final Preparations</Title>
            <Text>“Congratulations,” the Guide said with a smile. “You have chosen your paths. For your sake, I hope you have chosen wisely. And now for your final preparations for the upcoming tutorial.” [[The Guide waved their hand and long table appeared before Marcus, laden with a variety of objects. ]][[Maybe the stuff he identified he gets to keep, after all? Or some of it?]]
He pushed himself shakily to his feet, unsure of precisely how long he had to make these final preparations. Lying on the table he found a study leather rucksack with a tightly bound bedroll slung under it, a rune-engraved mixing bowl, a pile of dark green cloth, a leather belt with a sheath and a series of what looked like a dozen holders for slightly oversized shotgun shells, a dozen small glass vials the size of slightly oversized shotgun shells, a sharp, sturdy looking knife, two good-sized leather bound books with a strange quill-like pen, a second, larger pile of somewhat rougher, heavier cloth, and what looked like a long-bladed fighting spear.
“Your equipment for the tutorial,” the Guide explained when Marcus cast a glance at her. “I recommend you start gearing up, lest you miss something and are forced to do without it.”
With a sharp nod, Marcus stepped closer to the table and noticed something he had overlooked at first glance: a thick obsidian token roughly the size of a casino chip lying next to the rucksack. He grabbed the sack, noting that it was a sling bag with a wide strap to go across his body, and unfastened the flap and opened the mouth of the main bag. The he scooped up the token, dropped it in the mixing bowl and shoved the bowl into the bag. He grabbed the pile of green cloth and on looking closer, realized it was a long, sleeveless, over-tunic.
Setting the bag down carefully, he quickly donned the garment which seemed to shrink a bit so that it fit him properly. Then he grabbed the leather belt and fastened it around his waist before regarding vials. “Potions?” he asked the Guide.
“The red are vitality, the blue are mana and the green are stamina,” she confirmed. 
He quickly tucked each vial into one of the snug holders on his belt and then sheathed the knife on his left hip, opposite the vials. With a couple quick tugs and adjustments he settled the belt where he wanted it on his hips. The books and quill went into the bag, atop the cauldron and examined the second pile of cloth. It was a thick oilskin cloak with a deep hood, so he settled the bag’s strap into place and tightened it comfortably. After bouncing around on his feet, twisting, turning and otherwise testing the way his rucksack was properly settled wasn’t going to get in his way, he donned the cloak and picked up the spear.
The spear was roughly seven feet long, with a broad, winged spearhead that was a good 30-odd centimeters long. The blade was made of a black metal with razor sharp edges and strong, sharp point for thrusting. The moment he scooped it, his mana connected with it and he recognized that it was a mana weapon, much like the staff he had used before, only it was… better. Stronger, perhaps, than the staff had been. He spared a quick moment to identify it.

Uncommon Heirloom Draconic Warblade (Tier 2)
Requirements: Tier 1 or higher Draconic Race or Dragon Fire (Tier 1) Level 1 or higher. Soulbound. 
This perfectly balanced, razor sharp weapon is the favored weapon of the Draconic legions. It can be charged with mana to form a bolt of Dragon Fire that can be fired at will. Bolt may be overcharged for additional mana at the expense of a short cooldown before it can used again. Overcharging increases range or damage at wielder’s discretion. Wielder’s skill with Dragon Fire increases damage and reduces mana cost of the Bolts.  Alternatively, the Dragon Fire bolt can be spread along the weapon’s blade and maintained for a miniscule ongoing mana cost, imbuing melee attacks with Dragon Fire. Additional elemental concepts may be imbued along with Dragon Fire to further enhance damage and effects.
Enchanted to self-repair if damaged. 
Range increment: 300 meters

That was a helluva weapon right there. One he’d want to keep for some time to come, which prompted him to ask one more question before it was too late. “Could I use my epic upgrade token on this?” he shot a look at the Guide.
“You can, but I would recommend waiting until your tier has exceeded the weapon’s tier,” she answered. “Otherwise it would be a bit of a waste as the weapon would remain tier 2.”

“This is where we part,” the Guide said solemnly, inclining her head to Marcus. “Good luck and godspeed, Warmage.”
“Thank you,” he answered with a nod. “I cannot imagine that I could have been better prepared for this.”

            <Title>Earth</Title>
            <Text>“So, am I misremembering, or did the System say something about terraforming Earth because it was too small?” He asked, curious if this line of questions would be considered relevant.”
“That is inaccurate,” The Guide replied before clarifying. “The entire Sol system is being terraformed as modifying a singular planetary body within the required parameters would destabilize this star system.”
“Wait, what?” Marcus’s jaw dropped open. “The whole star system?!”
“Correct. There will be fewer terrestrial planets in this system, but each will be significantly larger than their pre-System equivalents.” The Guide explained, seemingly unconcerned by his reaction. “The gas giants will have been merged with your primary star, planetary distances from the primary will have been adjusted to keep habitable planets in equivalent positions within the Goldilocks zone, and new orbital patterns will have been established to accommodate increased planetary and stellar masses.” 
“How long will that take?” He felt completely overwhelmed by the degree of change that implied.
“Initial restructuring coincided with the Mana Adaptation period, with all non-sapient life having been returned to Earth at that time. The total duration of that period was 21 hours, 32 minutes and 7 seconds.” She continued calmly. “All non-sapient life will spend the duration of both the Introduction and the Tutorial periods adapting to the mana conditions on Earth and being strengthened sufficiently to provide a challenge for Earth’s sapient inhabitants.”
Well shit.

            <Title>Pre-evaluation explanations</Title>
            <Text>As soon as he read the last word on the screen, his Guide became animated once more and spoke, “Welcome to the Introduction period. The Introduction will begin with a series of evaluations to assess how well your mind, body and soul have adapted to being infused with the necessary mana for basic System Integration. These evaluations will also allow you to get used to the changes this has caused to your capabilities.”
“The first evaluation sequence is simple for a fixed duration. The mana density in this chamber will slowly increase. Initially this will allow you to grow accustomed to the increased presence of mana in your world. As the mana level continues to rise, it will allow me to determine your overall mana tolerance at your current stage of development.” She gave Marcus a gentle smile, “While this may be a strenuous experience, please rest assured that all reasonable efforts will be made to prevent you from experiencing unnecessary permanent damage from mana overexposure.”
Marcus’s eyes went wide, as that sank in. What constituted reasonable effort? And sure they’ll intervene to prevent unnecessary permanent damage, but that implied a level of necessary permanent damage being possible! “That’s not as reassuring as you might think.”
Without responding to his comment she continued to explain, “This evaluation will repeat multiple times, with a brief recovery period between evaluations. Each successive evaluation period will last longer and reach a more intense maximum density. The goal in this repetition pattern is to increase your mana tolerance from it’s baseline through repeated exposure. Please be advised that once this evaluation begins, the mana level in this chamber will never again reduce below the new mana density of the region you previously occupied on your homeworld.”
Marcus realized they were essentially subjecting him, and probably everyone else on Earth, to what amounted to exposure therapy. They’d ramp up the mana level as far as you could tolerate it and hold it there for as long as you could endure it before edging it back down to whatever the new normal would be back on Earth. And then they’d do it all over again after you had time to recover somewhat.

It appeared there was no way around it. Marcus accepted the inevitable, sat his naked ass down on the cool tile, crossed his legs in a fashion resembling a relaxed lotus position, and closed his eyes. He began focusing on his breathing, starting through the breathing exercises he used to cope with pain, just in case. Depending on just how strenuous this was, this could very well be akin to torture. No matter how intense it was, or wasn’t for that matter, he was pretty sure this was going to be a world of suck for a while.</Text>

            <Text>Marcus opened his eyes once again, satisfied that his mana pool was back to full capacity and he was ready for whatever came next. It was only as he stood up and stretched that it finally occurred to him that he last slept more than 24 hours ago, before the second evaluation began. He also hadn’t had any food or water for more than 60 hours now. He checked the time remaining until the next evaluation and his resource pools before pursuing the thought further.

Vitality: 119/119
Mana: 238/238
Stamina: 116/116

“So, how is it that I haven’t slept in more than 24 hours and haven’t needed to eat or drink in more than three days, yet I feel fine and don’t see any detrimental effects?” He asked. 
“Once a sapient has crossed the first mana compression threshold, their body adapts to use mana as its primary fuel source instead of requiring sustenance,” she answered with a smile. “You will only ever experience hunger or thirst if you are in a low mana area that is incapable of sustaining your core. As for sleep, meditation is an adequate substitute for sleep, capable of sustaining your mind for several days without needing actual sleep. so long as your mental energy is not overly depleted.”
“Mental energy? What do you mean?” He was quite positive there was no such thing on his status screen.
“Mental energy is a combination of stamina and soul stability. While not directly tracked by the System, it is a measure of your ability to be alert, aware and focused on a task. As it wanes, you will begin to feel mentally fatigued. Only actual sleep will restore your mental energy.”
“So I’m more likely to need sleep after intense mental activity, whereas restoring the body is a lot easier and can be accomplished with meditation?” He raised an eyebrow at the how backward that seemed.
“Essentially yes,” she agreed, “though that is an oversimplification. Even without intense mental activity, you will eventually run low on mental energy and require actual sleep. You simply won’t require it nearly so often as you once did.”
“Huh, that’s good to know.” Marcus nodded slightly as he considered it. “It will have a helluva an impact on civilization as a whole though.”

Rest break duration remaining 0:14:59
Initiating Final Evaluation in 0:14:59

As soon as the System notification popped up the Guide began her explanation of the upcoming evaluation cycle, “The next evaluation cycle will last for six hours. During this period you will be presented with a series of puzzles and problems to solve. These challenges will test your ability to parse and comprehend data and then use that data to make sound decisions.” 
“These challenges will be widely varied in both scope and topic, but each one will contain all the information necessary to solve it. You are permitted to skip two challenges per hour if you encounter something that well and truly stumps you. Each challenge must be completed before you can move on to the next one.”
“Do you have any questions about this evaluation?” She asked finally, having wrapped up what sounded suspiciously similar to a proctor dispensing instructions for some sort of standardized test.
“Only one,” Marcus replied with a wry grin, “if we encounter either an ambiguous challenge or a topic that we have no knowledge of, do we have any recourse for clarification other than skipping that challenge?”
The Guide paused once more in that odd aspect that reminded him she was not a truly sapient being and sometimes needed to query the System. “No. Each challenge will have sufficient context and information to clarify any potential ambiguities. Also the topics of each challenge are common enough that encountering one you have no knowledge of and being forced to skip it should not be burdensome to anyone from your world with a modicum of education.”
“Fair enough then,” he replied. Marcus had never found a need to really apply himself to his fullest during his academic career. Learning had always come rather easy for him, to the point where he had often found school interminably boring. He only hoped these would be more interesting than the standardized tests his home state had used.

Initiating Final Evaluation
Current Cycle Duration remaining 05:59:59

What followed was six hours of the most demanding academic challenges Marcus had ever been subjected to. Tests of logic, complex puzzles, questions aimed at proving his understanding of concepts related to the System, mana manipulation problems, and even questions meant to make him commit to value judgments. It was one-part college entrance exam, one-part IQ test, and one-part personality assessment. He would deeply pity the TA that would have had to grade such a thing back during his college years.
As the time crept by, he could feel the mental strain and fatigue accumulate exactly the way his Guide had told him it would, which did not bode well for the later cycles if the rest breaks were as short as they had been previously. At least it didn’t seem to be a complete waste.

Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Logical Analysis (Tier 1) Level 1! Intelligence has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Mana Theory (Tier 1) Level 1! Intelligence has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Intuitive Problem Solving (Tier 1) Level 1! Wisdom has increased by 1!
Current Cycle Duration remaining 0:59:58

Although, he was fairly sure that last skill meant he was technically not conforming to the intent of the evaluation, but he was definitely moving right along. Not that he expected any great gains in the final hour. Each skill had required hours to unlock and he was fairly sure that was the primary reason for the length of the evaluation. It seemed these sorts of mental skills were harder to acquire and advance without a specific path granting them.
The final hour consisted of the most difficult and complex problems of the entire cycle, with each having more than one solution to achieve the stated goal, with each solution having its own pros, cons, and possible side effects. He assumed this was intended to judge foresight and how much one would allow themselves to be inconvenienced to reduce negative effects on others. The only problem was, that given the stated intent of the System, Marcus wasn’t sure reducing the negative impacts on others would be judged as a good thing…
Finally, mere moments after selecting a solution to what would be his final challenge, the cycle expired and he was confronted with a surprising notification.

Current Evaluation Cycle completed!
Rest period duration remaining 2:29:59
Congratulations! For your performance on this evaluation you have been awarded a title!
You have earned the title ‘Professional Problem Solver’. Title grants +3 each to Intelligence and Wisdom.

Marcus grinned at his new title before crawling into the bedroll his Guide had provided at the end of the first evaluation and taking a much deserved nap.</Text>

            <Text>
Current Evaluation Cycle completed!
Introduction time remaining: 93:19:59
Initiating Second Evaluation in 10:09:59

The mana around Marcus had dropped in density to the point that he had to actively think about it to feel it, much like had between evaluation cycles. Since that was the new norm for where he was on Earth, at least he knew that wouldn’t be an issue. It also seemed the System was giving them a break to rest and recover between evaluations, which was welcome. 
“Would you like an opportunity to rest or would you prefer to continue our discussion from before the evaluation began?” his Guide asked with a smile.
“Can we do both?” he grinned wryly. “That evaluation was more than 24 hours long and I barely napped an hour during that time. I could use some rest, but I’d love to ask a few new questions after I sleep a while.”
“That is quite acceptable. Approximately 10 minutes before the evaluation begins, I will explain the upcoming evaluation. In the meantime you can rest and/or ask questions at your discretion. If you choose to sleep, I can wake you at any point you specify,” she gestured and a bedroll appeared on the floor next to him. It consisted of a thin foam pad, a thick sleeping bag, and a small pillow, all of which were bound to be more comfortable than a cold tile floor.
“Thank you.” Marcus crawled onto the bedroll and considered the time available before he continued, “I usually don’t sleep much more than 5 or 6 hours a night, but please make sure I’m awake at least 2 hours and ten minutes before the next evaluation begins.”
“As you wish,” the Guide replied, then she gestured at the ceiling and the lights in the chamber slowly to faded out. By the time the light was gone, Marcus was deeply asleep.

            <Title>Bad Business</Title>
            <Text>Marcus smiled and stretched a bit as he stood up. Dinner had been excellent, well worth both the time and money spent. [After a couple of beers with the meal], he felt relaxed and refreshed as he made his way toward the closest elevator. That feeling lasted right up until Dennis Leary began singing ‘I’m an asshole’ from the phone in his pocket, which tossed his relaxation out the window. He only had one person who’d been set to that ring tone for his trip, and he was sure that he would not enjoy this phone call.
Fishing out his phone, he injected forced cheerfulness into his deep baritone, “Craig, this better be an actual, honest to god emergency or I’m going to key your Porsche when I get back.”
“Damn it, Marcus, that’s not funny! When were you going to tell me that Jimmy offered to buy you out? I thought we were in this together?” 
“We were. Actually still are since I haven’t made a decision yet one way or the other,” he answered, “but if you try to say you’re surprised I’m considering it then you’ve been lying to yourself. You know damn well that my heart hasn’t been in it for a while now.”
“I thought that was the point of this whole vacation thing?” Craig countered, “You spend a week in Vegas followed by a week on a Cruise ship, you clear your head and get back in the game.”
“Or I spend those two weeks clearing my head and decide that what’s best for the business is selling my half to Jimmy and riding off into the sunset,” Marcus shot back. “Either way it’s win-win for you cause you’ll either get a motivated partner back in two weeks, or a partner who’s transitioning out to let someone who cares take over.”
“Oh, stow that bullshit. You know Jimmy’s dead weight when it comes to dealing with clients. On his best days he’s half the closer you are on your worst days.”
“Then find somebody else to offer me more than Jimmy did,” he retorted. “I’m tired, Craig. The world is turning to shit around us and I’m just done pretending to care about things that have stopped mattering to me. I’ll send you a copy of Jimmy’s offer, but if you or someone else doesn’t make a better offer than it than I’m making no promises. And if you call me again before I get back, I’ll accept Jimmy’s offer on the spot and you can fucking deal with it. I’m done talking about this.”
Marcus hung up the phone and struggled for a brief moment with the urge to fling it across the hotel concourse. He breathed deeply, focusing on letting go of his frustration. Once upon a time, he and Craig had been equally invested in the security consulting group they’d set up, but they’d ultimately had different standards for constituted success. Craig had always wanted more: more money, more clients, more renown. Marcus, on the other hand, had wanted a life. He wanted enough money to live well, but didn’t need to live extravagantly. He didn’t need a Porsche and a McMansion, didn’t need the newest latest best in everything, didn’t need bespoke suits and a millionaire life. 
Of course, Craig’s marriage had ended in divorce specifically because he wasn’t providing those things to his wife, so maybe Marcus could understand some of the drive there. Since the divorce, however, Craig had been impossible. The job had become his entire life and he spent way too much time listening to podcasts and streams from big shot tech-bros and venture capitalist types. Suddenly his business partner thought they both needed to work  12 hour days 6 days a week to turn their enterprise into something “real.” Marcus thought that was overkill. They didn’t need to be the next Amazon or Google or whatever. There was no way their security consulting group was ever going to be a Fortune 500 company. It just wasn’t realistic.
Letting out a final deep breath that totally wasn’t a sigh, Marcus made up his mind. If Craig wanted to take a small, regional company like theirs and make them some giant national or even multinational concern, he could do it without Marcus. He turned back to his phone, typed up a quick email, attached a copy of the offer Jimmy had made for his interest in the group. 
He sent the email and felt a weight lift off his chest, felt himself melt back into a calm state of mind. [It was the right choice, for him and all he needed to worry about was him and his almost adult daughter.] Craig could figure his own shit out.</Text>

            <Text>Rest period duration remaining 0:39:12

Marcus slowly became aware of his surroundings once more and sat up slowly. The ache he had felt building up in his head was gone, but he still felt more mentally drained than he had after his last nap. He could feel the waiting System notifications from his meditation training, but was a little bit wary of looking at them. He had quickly lost track of the Guide’s instructions and had no idea if he’d accomplished anything more than just exhausting himself and passing out. His perception had gotten so… fuzzy as his fatigue had set in that he didn’t trust his memories entirely. Still, he could hardly put it off forever, so he pulled them up to see how he did.

Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) Level 28 has evolved to Novice Meditation (Tier 3) Level 4! Wisdom has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Novice Intuitive Problem Solving (Tier 2) Level 20 has evolved to Apprentice Intuitive Problem Solving (Tier 3) Level 1! Wisdom increased by 1!
Congratulations! Novice Meditation (Tier 3) Level 30 has evolved to Apprentice Meditation (Tier 4) Level 1! Wisdom has increased by 1!

His jaw dropped open. Two meditation evolutions?! How the hell had he managed that? The Intuitive Problem Solving had to come from his inspirations on how to ‘become one with his mana’ and the realization that it felt like a new ‘muscle’… He considered it for a few long moments. The first evolution had to have come when he’d begun to ‘dissolve’ himself in his mana. Then as he spread himself through his entire internal mana flow that skill must have rocketed up in levels. The second evolution had to be tied to him beginning to exercise his new control… He nodded to himself. Yeah, that made the most sense based on his memories of the training. He pulled up his status to see the overall effect of the evaluation so far.

His wisdom was now the clear front runner among his stats, having barely edged out his dexterity. He also noticed that his meditation skill had still had ample time to climb even further after evolving. Not bad progress for having little more than a single hint on what to do and a whole lot of intuition.
“Your overall progress has been quite exemplary,” The Guide commented, as if reading his mind… or maybe just his body language and facial expression. “You are considerably ahead of the average sapient in terms of your stats, skills, and titles. Placing you among your world’s new elites, though the System won’t fully acknowledge that until the end of the evaluation.”
“Well, that’s definitely nice to know,” Marcus scratched his bearded chin and considered his experiences so far. “So I have two questions, if you’re amenable?”
“Certainly, we still have some time before this rest period ends after all,” the Guide answered with a smile.
“Great! First question, what determines my recovery speeds?”
“Generally physical recovery speeds are linked to your endurance and mental recovery speeds are tied to your willpower,” she replied immediately. “This can be affected by a number of other factors, however, such as local mana density, how active you are being, external magical effects, and skills such as meditation.” 
“Can you clarify that a bit?” he asked.
“Certainly. Vitality is the slowest resource to regenerate naturally. While sleeping, you will regenerate vitality equal to approximately 25% of your endurance every hour. That amount is halved if you are awake but resting and limiting physical activity. If you are engaging in non-strenuous physical activity it is halved a second time. Strenuous physical activity will halve it a third time.” She paused and looked at him to confirm he was following.
“So, in my case, 4 Vitality an hour sleeping, 2 while resting, 1 while being active, and 1 Vitality every two hours if I’m doing anything strenuous?” he confirmed.
“Correct. As meditation is the only skill you have which affects recovery, while meditating you will regenerate vitality as if you were sleeping. Vitality is the resource meditation assists recovering the least.”
“Okay, how about stamina then?” he prompted.
“Stamina recovers the fastest normally. You will regain twice your endurance per hour of sleep, which is halved by resting the same as vitality. However, since stamina itself fuels all physical activity, the penalties for physical activity are much steeper. Non-strenuous physical activity will reduce your stamina recovery to 10% of your endurance per hour with strenuous activity reducing it to 1% of your endurance.  Meditation will increase your stamina recovery to your endurance times your meditation skill tier per hour.” She paused again for confirmation. 
[“Ouch. So 24 stamina an hour sleeping, 12 while resting, 1 per hour while being active, and 1 every 10 hours of strenuous activity. But a full 48 per hour of meditation?” He frowned in confusion. “Then why was I recovering… almost 7 per minute while meditating earlier?”
“The introduction accelerates stamina recovery rates significantly to ensure your ability to effectively participate. This generally means you will recover your full stamina pool from nearly empty with approximately 15 minutes of meditation, no matter how deep your pool.”
“Ah, that makes sense,” he nodded, considering. “No boosts to mana or vitality recovery?”
“Vitality recovery during the introduction is a special case, as any damage or injuries incurred will be automatically healed at the beginning of any rest period.” She replied. “Mana recovery is boosted such that during the introduction you will regain a minimum of 30 mana per hour per tier of meditation skill per hour, or one-half mana per minute per tier.”
“So what’s normal mana recovery like then?” he asked with a wince. His mana pool was huge compared to his vitality or stamina and that could take a long time to regenerate outside the introduction.
“Mana recovery is a bit more complicated than the other resources. Skills that affect your ability to manipulate mana have significant impact on how quickly you can refill your mana core, which in itself increases the amount of mana you possess since you don’t truly have a mana core until after the first compression of your pool when it reaches tier 1.” She paused to make sure he was following her explanation. At his nod, she continued. “For someone like you, the formula for mana recovery is mana control skill tier minus mana core compression tier times half your willpower per hour.”
“So… three times half my willpower.. Or about 15 per hour?” he asked as he did the mental math.
“Incorrect. Your prodigy titles increase your effective mana control tier by 30%. The net result is an effective mana control tier of 6.5 not 5, so four and a half times half your willpower or 23 mana per hour.
“Oh! I forgot those! That means that meditating now brings my mana recovery back up to 92 per hour, naturally?”
“Correct. Your skills have exceeded the recovery rate as boosted by the introduction as of the last evaluation cycle.”
“Well, damn, that means it would take a bit more than 6 hours of meditation to completely refill my mana core at this point.” He shook his head. “My mana bolt uses something like… three and a half percent of my current mana pool, and it around 13 minutes of meditation to recover that much mana. There has to be something I can do to make that less… lopsided.”][Too numbers-heavy, but excellent logic. KEEP the info somewhere for YOURSELF.]
“Continued improvement of the spell will improve it’s mana efficiency, allowing you to get more from each point of mana spent and reducing the minimum cost,” the Guide explained. “Advancing your mana control and meditation skills will make each point of mana spent easier to recover. At this stage of your development, your mana compression is almost as much of a hindrance to your mana recovery as it is a boon to your pool depth.”
He nodded again, then loudly and theatrically sighed, “The trials of being a prodigy. I will just have to persevere.”
“So, last question then, why does my race have the word unknown in parentheses before its tier?”
“Each Dragonkin, and subsequently each Dragonkin-Hybrid, has a specific elemental affinity resulting from their dragon blood,” the Guide explained in response. “Until you have discovered that affinity for yourself, it will not appear on your status screen. Once you discover that affinity, deepening that affinity will cause some visible changes to your body, principally affecting your scale coloration.”
“Ah. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense actually.”</Text>

            <Text>Rest period duration remaining 0:14:59

The System notification starting the break between cycles broke Marcus out of his meditation. Thankfully, he felt almost fully rested, a feeling he confirmed with a glance at his stamina pool.

Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) has improved to Level 18!
Stamina: 100/105

He rose to his feet and moved around a little, still finding no lingering stiffness or pain after his exertion. “So what’s up with the last evaluation?” He asked casually. 
“The final cycle of this evaluation will focus on testing your dexterity in the form of hand-eye coordination, perception, kinesthetic sense, and accuracy.” The Guide answered. “A variety of targets will randomly appear at various distances and angles and for random durations. You will be required to hit as many of these targets as you can. You will be given a choice of tool for this test. The options are a throwing spike that will immediately re-appear in your hand after hitting or missing its target, a pistol crossbow that will instantly reload itself after being fired, a dart thrower with firing characteristics resembling a 9mm slug-thrower native to your world, or a wizard implement such as a wand or staff that is fired by pushing a bit of your mana through it.”
“Will we be given time to get used to the tool we select? Or is our adaptation time part of the evaluation?” 
“You will be given 5 minutes and a maximum of 15 attempts to hit a stationary target at what is considered optimal distance for the [tool you choose to familiarize yourself with the tools characteristics.”] The Guide replied. “During the evaluation you will be expected to move around within the test range to help adjust angles and distances.”
“During that 5 minute period can we try more than one tool, to find what best suits us?”
“If desired yes, but a change of tool does not reset the 5 minute period,” The Guide waved their hand a table appeared in front of Marcus with the spike, crossbow and pseudo-pistol on it. “Wand or Staff?” The Guide asked.
Marcus considered for a moment before answering, “Staff.” After all, if he was going to pursue a path of magic, then a ranged magic implement that could also be used to hit someone seemed the better choice. “Would physically striking a target with the staff also count?” he asked as that thought crossed his mind.
The Guide paused for a long moment before replying, “The evaluation puts no limitations on how you hit the targets other than having to hit them with your chosen tool.” With a second wave of its hand the staff appeared. 
The staff was less like the quarterstaves he was accustomed to seeing in martial arts classes and more like a walking stick he expected a hiker to carry. It was mostly straight and smooth, but looked like a lacquered length of natural wood, knobbed, slightly crooked, and considerably thicker at one end than the other. Marcus hefted the length of wood with both hands. It weighed about what he would expect of a good, dense hardwood, maybe even a tiny bit more. [He tested it for flex and] found it stout enough that he could easily imagine braining someone with the heavy end without damage to the staff. 
Focusing a bit, he could sense a complex mana structure within the wood. One that he believed was meant to focus and amplify the mana fed into it. With a moment of consideration, he pushed a bit of his mana out of his hand and into the staff. Immediately he felt it change into a destructive bolt of energy held stably in the core of the staff. [The act of charging the staff to fire also resulted in immediately gaining a skill and a basic understanding of how the bolt could be discharged ]

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Mana Weapons (Tier 1) Level 1! 

“Familiarization begins now,” The Guide intoned and sudden Marcus was in what looked like a gymnasium. 
He looked ahead and saw a glowing sphere that was probably a meter in diameter appear about 25 meters away. It looked pretty close to what he remembered a sighting  range looking like when he was in the army. Following the information gained from his new skill, he pointed the thicker top of the staff at the target and discharged the bolt with a thought. What looked like a spike of blue-white energy seemed to explode from the part of the staff he’d pointed and raced across the distance faster than an arrow would, but slower than a bullet. Only it didn’t drop at all over that distance, resulting in a glancing hit at the top of the target which deflected the bolt upwards and into the ceiling of the range.
“Holy shit.” He murmured softly. “What’s the maximum effective range of these bolts?”
“Variable,” the Guide replied, “dependent on the amount of mana infused. Approximately 150 meters per unit of mana expended, though damage will decrease over distance unless you focus on separating mana into payload and propulsion.”
He nodded, his skill giving him some idea of how to do just that. “How much payload will these targets need during the evaluation?”
“One unit of propulsion mana without a dedicated payload will suffice if you hit the target solidly during this evaluation.”
Nodding, Marcus adjusted how he aimed before charging and firing in a single burst of mana and intent. This time he hit dead center, causing the target to flash brightly. He grinned and repeated the shot a half dozen times, intentionally lowering the staff each time to force him to re-aim each time.  There was less than a centimeter variance in the impact point, even as he sped up and aimed faster each time.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Perception (Tier 1) Level 1! Dexterity has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Marksmanship (Tier 1) Level 1! Dexterity has increased by 1!

The Guide’s eyes widened. “That is impressive. Do you have prior training in some form of marksmanship?”
“Yes,” he replied with a smile, “I most certainly do. I was ‘Top Shot’ when I graduated the US Army Sniper Course.”
“Ah. That explains much.” The Guide nodded. “One minute remaining for familiarization.”
Marcus spent the next minute firing several bolts while moving and adjusting for its effects before stopping. He could still feel the grin stretching his mouth. This was going to be fun…

Beginning Final Evaluation Cycle…
Cycle duration remaining: 1:59:59

Two hours, and more than 180 targets later, Marcus slumped onto the floor, still grinning like a madman. His mana and stamina were almost completely drained and his staff had vanished, but he was more than happy with his gains from the evaluation in both skills and stats. He’d gained five skill evolutions, with three of them granting an additional point of Dexterity, and new titles.

Marcus grinned at the name of the final title. It seemed the exact names of titles might just be adjusted a bit for the people they were awarded to.

            <Title>Path Selection - Profession</Title>
            <Text>“So onto professions now I suppose,” he said looking to the Guide. “How are professions different from classes again?”
“Professions tend to be less combat oriented than classes, though there are some overlaps between the two. Professions tend to fall into three broad categories: crafting of some kind, influence and leadership, or knowledge driven, though their are exceptions and some straddle the lines between the categories,” she explained briefly. 
“Ah, so… things to fill downtime with,” Marcus nodded. “Got it.”
“That is a gross oversimplification to the point of ridiculousness.” The Guide rolled their eyes and sighed as they responded. “Many professions provide a path to power that can be as compelling as any class, while others supplement and enhance the paths provided by  classes. Relegating them to… glorified hobbies is insulting.”
“Okay, that’s probably fair, but unless there’s a choice in there as interesting as the Prophesied Warmage of the Elder Dragons? Yeah, gonna be a little hard to be excited about it.”
With a resigned sigh, the Guide continued snippily, “Shall we begin? Please?” 
He grinned and nodded, “By all means.” Instantly five options appeared on a screen before him and started going through them from the top. 

Aspiring Alchemist (Uncommon) - Your well-developed skills in manipulating mana and your impressive ability to analyze and solve problems have opened the doorway to pursue greatness as an Alchemist. Learn to create potions to restore your resources, flasks to grant you buffs, poisons to impede your enemy and countless other products as you climb the path to power this profession provides.
Primary Stats: Intelligence, Endurance
Bonus stats per tier: +1 Intelligence, +1 Endurance, +1 free point
Core Class skills: Herbalism, Alchemist’s Detection, Craft Potion, Alchemical Purification
One additional skill every 5 levels

Okay, not the worst thing he could have been offered. Marcus could definitely see the usefulness of being able to brew his own potions. It was a solid, low rarity offering. And the new skill every 5 levels was also surprising, since it took a legendary class to get more skill choices than that. 

Aspiring Artificer (Uncommon) - Your strong focus on magic and crafting spells opens the path for you to become an artificer. Artificers are the mad scientists of the magical world, crafting interesting and often unique items imbued with an astounding variety of magical abilities. 
Primary Stats: Intelligence, Wisdom
Bonus Stats per tier: +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom, +1 free point
Core Class skills: [Choice of Basic Crafting Skills], Mana Construct Theory, Anchor Mana Construct, Conceptual Exploration
One additional skill every 5 levels

For a low rarity class this one was interesting. It seemed designed to allow him to craft magical trinkets and objects to supplement his class which didn’t seem as immediately useful as crafting potions, but Conceptual Exploration was particularly appealing. He identified the skill for more details.

Skill: Conceptual Exploration (Rare)
This skill allows the user to study the concepts within an existing mana construct in order to identify them and see how they interact with the construct as a whole. This process is slow and deliberate and requires constant access to the construct to work. Can help the user gain a deeper understanding of the concepts at play.

Yep, that skill alone might be worth taking a profession. Anything that helps with understanding concepts was pure gold for someone as magic oriented as he was. Still, it was only a rare skill on an uncommon class. Maybe it would be offered by one of the rarer classes as well.

Aspiring Magical Researcher (Uncommon) - You have committed yourself to walk even the most esoteric paths of magical research and will stop at nothing to plumb the secrets of the arcane arts. You do not seek the short term gains of creation, but a deeper understanding of very concept of magic itself.
Primary Stats: Intelligence, Wisdom
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
Core Class skills: Research Concept, Mana Construct Theory, Spell Theory, Ritual and Formation Theory
One additional skill every 5 levels

Marcus grimaced at this one. He wasn’t above doing research when something needed doing, but a profession focused purely on research with no intention of putting that research to practical use? That did not seem like a good use of time. Research for its own sake definitely had its place in the world, but Marcus was not that place.

Aspiring Noble of the Dragonflights (Epic) - You walk the path of the true dragons and seek to lead the dragonflights to greatness in your wake. Your presence inspires those that follow you and demoralizes those who oppose you. Long live the Dragonflights!
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Intelligence, Luck
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence, +1 Luck, +1 free point
Core Class skills: Leadership, Inspiration, Intimidation, Voice of Command, Subterfuge, Manipulation
One additional skill every 5 levels
 
After reading through this skill twice, Marcus still didn’t really understand why it was being offered to him aside from the obvious tie the class had to dragons. It was a politician’s class, and he was not and did not aspire to be a politician. So that was a definite hard pass.

Prodigious Arcanist of Lost Mysteries (Ancient) - You walk in places untouched for centuries, among the ruins of lost civilizations and dead cultures in pursuit of secrets long forgotten. You study ancient and forbidden magics in a effort to recreate long dead arcana and recreate destroyed artifacts of lost eras. Part-archaeologist, Part-explorer, all magical researcher and craftsman, your laboratory is ancient ruins and your workshop where-ever you rest your head.
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Intelligence, Agility
Bonus Stats per tier: +2 Wisdom, +1 Intelligence, +1 Agility, +2 free points
Core Class skills: Pathfinding, Trap Detection, Mana Construct Theory, Anchor Mana Construct, Herbalism, Craft Potion, Alchemist’s Detection
One Additional skill on selection, one additional skill every 5 levels

Once again, it seemed the system had saved the best option last. This profession looked to combine an artificer, an alchemist and Indiana Jones in tidy little package wrapped up with more skills and stat points than any other option with a neat bow. What kid in his generation hadn’t grown up dreaming of being an intrepid explorer roaming through dark jungles and lost cities?
“I select Prodigious Arcanist of Lost Mysteries,” he said after a few moments of consideration. 

Skill Choices available!
Select on of the following skills: Tinkering, Smithing, Woodcarving, Alchemical Purification, Conceptual Exploration

Grinning widely, that was the easiest choice he’d been offered since he saw his class, “I choose conceptual exploration.” With choice having been made, a sudden rush flowed through him as he gained the stat points from his class and profession and new knowledge slammed into his brain. The intensity of it drove him to his knees and left him panting.

            <Title>Waking and Talking</Title>
            <Text>Marcus slept dreamlessly, or at least it seemed so to him. He knew from college psych classes that [everyone would dream multiple dreams every night,] but he definitely didn’t remember dreaming this time. Which seemed weird given everything that happened. The moment he opened his eyes on the pitch black chamber he’d been in since the System arrived, the lights in the chamber gradually brightened and he was confronted with a System message.

Introduction time remaining: 86:51:18
Initiating Second Evaluation in 03:41:18

Some quick mental math told him he’d slept almost six and a half hours, and he felt completely refreshed, in spite of having been awake for almost 27 straight hours. That felt… off somehow. Maybe the mana in his system helped refresh him faster? Another question to ask, at any rate. 
Thinking of mana, he turned his senses inward and observed his mana flows, happily finding them stable and his core completely refilled at it’s new density. This did not mean that he was anywhere near ready to try another compression, only that his mana pool was once again full. Honestly, the mana around him now was so thin compared to the evaluations that he doubted he could even attempt a third compression in these conditions at all. 
He sat up, expected a degree of stiffness from sleep, only to find he felt like he had when he was [back in his 20’s, which was almost 30 years ago.] Still, he gingerly got to his feet and felt… nothing. No pain, no stiffness, no hunger, no thirst. On the contrary, he felt energized, clear-headed and ready to take on the world. Looking around he noticed his Guide regarding him.
“I believe the proper greeting in your culture would be… Good morning?” she made it more of a question than a statement, with a faint trace of a smile on her face.
“And good morning to you as well,” he answered. “Did you sleep? Or do you even need such things being a projection of the System?”
“I did not and do not. In spite of appearing to be a biological organism, I am not actually one. While you slept, I monitored you and the time, so that I could wake you as requested if necessary.”
“Monitored me?” Marcus’s face twisted in an uncomfortable expression. “That’s… nice.”
“It is part of my purpose. I am here to Guide you and act to preserve your life within reason. That requires me to be aware of your status.”
“My… status?” His uncomfortable expression transitioned into an actual frown.
“Yes. You may also access your status as well, by saying or thinking the command ‘show status’,” she explained.
“Show status,” he repeated, causing a screen to appear before him.

Marcus stared slack jawed at the information presented to him, it was a lot to take in. Really, a lot. Luckily, he understood most of the basics from context. His Vitality was a measure of how much physical damage he could take, mana was an abstraction of how much mana was in his core, and stamina probably measured how much physical exertion he could undertake before exhausting himself. Glancing over his other stats he quickly realized  that he couldn’t directly link any of his stats to his resource pools, so there must be some math going on behind the scenes that he didn’t see. And several of the stats were somewhat… ambiguous in meaning.
“What’s the difference between agility and dexterity?” he asked, that being the first thing to spring to his mind.
“Agility is a measure of gross motor control, your ability to coordinate and control the large muscle groups in your body. Dexterity is a measure of fine motor control, your ability to coordinate and control the small muscles in your body and perform precise movements.”
“Ah, that makes sense. I’ve always wondered why those get lumped into a single thing so often in games. And what do intelligence and wisdom represent in this context?” he followed up with his next question. 
“Intelligence is composite of how quickly and accurately you can think and analyze data within your knowledge base. It also reflects your learning speed. Wisdom is your ability to evaluate the reliability of data and weight that reliability in your decision making process, it also reflects your intuition and ability to understand esoterica. Wisdom determines the depth of your mana pool in conjuction with your core compression and contributes to soul stability,” she smiled and continued. “Or as they put it on your world: Intelligence is recognizing a tomato is a fruit and Wisdom is knowing it doesn’t go in fruit salad.”
Marcus burst out laughing. “I hadn’t expected you to know that reference,” he admitted after a few moments. “Since you brought it up though, what exactly is Soul Stability?”
“In the Multiverse, everything you are: your knowledge, your stats, your abilities, your psyche, everything, is contained within your soul. It is a complete record of your entire life from birth onward and is the seat of what makes you you,” she explained. “When someone uses a spell or ability to attempt to usurp control of your self or to attack your psyche, those are attacks against your soul and will degrade your Soul Stability. Traumatic events and mental shocks can also degrade your Soul Stability. Prior to the System adapting your body for mana, your Soul Stability was significantly impacted by your experiences in the military, for example.”
“My PTSD reduces my Soul Stability?” Marcus could certainly understand that being the case after all..
“No. Your PTSD reduced your Soul Stability before System intervention. The condition you call PTSD caused physical alterations to your brain. Those changes were undone as part of mana adaptation.” She clarified, “While you may continue to exhibit some of those behaviors, it is because your mind remembers, but those memories should no longer elicit the same visceral responses they once did because the biochemistry and brain structures responsible have been corrected.”
“The System cured my PTSD?” Marcus was thunderstruck by what that would mean for the human race.
“Along with most other structural and biochemical brain abnormalities,” she confirmed. “Part of the mana adaptation process involved repairing all significant damage to the physical body, including the brain. Though remembered behaviors and triggers may persist for a while, they are now matters of habit rather than malfunction.”
“That’s… that’s incredible.” [He was having a hard time truly comprehending what that would mean for him or humanity as a whole.] Then his logical brain prodded him with the reminder that he was working on a deadline and still needed more information. “So what does Willpower affect then if Soul Stability is a measure of my… mental fortitude?”
“Willpower is a measure of your ability to cope with mental shocks, to resist pain, and to resist adversity. It provides the bulk of your base Soul Stability and a small portion of your base Vitality.”
Ah ha! “And I’d assume the rest of Vitality is based on Endurance?” 
“That is correct for base Vitality. And the remainder of your base Soul Stability is based on your Wisdom and Mana Core Compression.”
“Mana Core Compression?” That was somewhat surprising.
“Your Mana Core is part of your Soul. Compressing it strengthens your soul.” 
“Okay, I think I can see that. And I assume those resource pools will increase as I raise my Level?”
“Vitality, Mana and Stamina will increase as you level, yes. Soul Stability will only increase as either your Willpower, Wisdom, or Core Compression improves.”
“Oh. So then, everyone’s Soul is a bit of a soft target compared to Vitality?”
“In a manner of speaking, perhaps. But permanent damage to the Soul is difficult to inflict and it regenerates more rapidly than any other resource pool.” She tilted her head slightly, “Also, Soul attacks can only kill you if they completely obliterate your Soul, which is extremely difficult for mortal beings to accomplish. Destabilizing your Soul will only allow them to render you temporarily vulnerable to mental manipulations and psychic influences.”
“Ah! That makes more sense… its more of a threshold they have to overcome!” Marcus nodded his understanding. 
“That is not an inaccurate assessment, if somewhat simplistic.” His Guide conceded the point.
“Okay, so what do these stat numbers actually mean? I mean, I assume more is better, but how do my stats compare to human averages?”
“Pre-System humans would fall between 0 and 7 in most cases with an average around 3  or 4 and truly exceptional individuals perhaps reaching as 8 or even 9. The mana adaptation process caused an upward shift in most stats, such that adapted humans now average between 5 and 8 in most stats.” She paused and glanced at him to ensure he was following her explanation. “Your Agility and Wisdom are slightly below average, likely resulting from physical and psychological damage before the system limiting them. Your Willpower is significantly higher than average.”
“My busted ass leg and my PTSD,” he agreed nodding. “Can stats be increased? Other than by titles, which obviously increased my stats.” 
“At various stages in your progression, you will gain additional titles that improve your stats automatically. You will also get direct stat increases from improving certain skills and abilities, and a small number of stat points you may distribute directly as you level.” She smiled, “You will likely gain some of those types of skills and abilities from some of the remaining evaluations and also from any class or professions you acquire.”
“And how do I gain classes or professions? And how does that work?” 
“The last thing that will happen in the Introduction is the choice of a Class or Profession. You will potentially have opportunities in your Tutorial period to pick up whichever of the two you did not select during the Introduction.”
“And what’s the difference between the two? Are you stuck with whatever you choose? What benefits do they provide?” He grew excited once more as the gamer geek in him latched on to the idea.
“Classes and professions are two different types of path. Classes tend to be more focused on combat and dealing with physical dangers. Professions tend to be much less directly applicable in combat, often focusing on crafting or more esoteric things.” [She paused as if considering, or checking how much information she was able to divulge at this stage.] [SYSTEM PROCESSING] “All paths provide the same general types of benefits: namely skills and abilities. When you select a path you will immediately be granted a set of core skills and abilities for that path, some of which may even be entirely unique to that path. As you improve in those core skills, you will advance the Tier of your chosen path. At each new Tier, you will gain one or more additional skills and abilities. At some Tiers you may also encounter branches in your path, allowing you to choices that will further shape your future path.”
The Guide paused again allowing all of that information to sink in before they continued, “You may also encounter opportunities to abandon a path in favor of a new one, especially during your Tutorial period, but occasionally even later on. Be warned however that abandoning a path is not without its consequences. You may lose access to skills and abilities and possibly even Tier progress when changing paths.”
  Marcus nodded slowly. That all made sense and meant he needed to consider his choices carefully. Which meant he needed more information to make better choices. “What exactly are skills and abilities?” 
“Skills and abilities are System-assisted actions you can learn to perform. They can be obtained one of two ways: either being directly granted by the System during advancement or by demonstrating a sufficient level of innate or learned proficiency resulting in the System-assist kicking in and granting you the skill. The skill you currently have resulted from you learning and progressing the techniques I taught you during the evaluation, and even refining them beyond what you were taught.”
“So if I demonstrate sufficient proficiency in something, the System will just award me a skill for it?” 
“Essentially, yes,” she answered. “Though performance in a stressful situation or circumstance is far more likely to result in a skill than performance under relaxed circumstances unless what you are demonstrating is particularly complex or delicate.”
“And using a skill to perform difficult tasks is what advances them?” 
“All use of skills works to advance them, but difficult tasks or new applications of the skill result in faster progress.” She paused a moment before offering an example, “Compressing your Mana Core is a good example. Each time you did it, it required you to refine new techniques and push the limits of your existing techniques. Thus, it resulted in significant advancement each time.”
Marcus nodded and considered his status screen once more. “How do I make the status screen go away? And can I hide System notifications as well when they might interfere with what I’m doing?”
“Simply say or think ‘hide status’. You may also say or think ‘hide notifications’ though notifications graded as urgent will still display when received. Also please note that System commands like these require intent when spoken or thought. You cannot hide or show notifications or the status screen accidentally.”
“Good to know.” He dismissed both the status screen and the notification screen he could just see behind it with a thought before practicing the process a few times to get comfortable with it. Then he asked his final pertinent question, one he’d been holding on to for a while now. “So, magic is a thing then? You mentioned spells earlier I think?”</Text>

            <Title>Apocalypse Now-ish</Title>
            <Text>Marcus spent some time in the hotel concourse people watching before heading to his room. There was something appealing about the strange slice of the world that was a Las Vegas resort hotel and casino. Some people were busy throwing money away in the hopes of striking it rich. Others were just smiling and pretending they didn’t hate their jobs as they dealt with stuck up pricks. He watched some couples argue about who’s fault it was as they lost more money than they could afford and watched others embrace in celebration as they won big. After about half an hour, he felt his phone vibrate with a text message and fished it out to see it was an apology from Craig, who asked for a week to come up with a counter to Jimmy’s offer. Marcus replied that he had until the day he was back from this trip to make a solid offer before turning his phone completely off and putting it away. 
He pushed himself to his feet, feeling his leg complain again at the motion. He leaned heavily on his cane as he made his way to a nearby VIP elevator and tapped his room card to the access reader. He once again thanked his own foresight for splurging on the VIP package as trudging back to the main elevators definitely did not appeal at the moment. It was past time to get up to his room and soak his aching joints. A few short moments later, the elevator door slid open with a soft ding and Marcus slipped inside. He tapped his room card on the inside control panel and slumped against the side of the elevator. The doors closed with a second soft ding and he felt the elevator smoothly rise up its shaft.
He smiled as the silence of the elevator car enveloped him, the first real silence he’d experienced in who knew how many hours. Then, after a scant handful of floors, the lights in the elevator flickered and died, plunging the enclosed space into complete darkness as the machine stopped dead in its tracks.
“What the hell?” Marcus muttered aloud into the darkness. “A power outage shouldn’t have killed the emergency lights too.” 
Standing up straighter and leaning on his cane, Marcus turned toward the elevator’s control panel and began feeling around blindly for the emergency button. If nothing else, he needed to notify someone that he was trapped.
Suddenly, what looked like a holographic computer screen appeared floating in front of him in the pitch black space. In glowing letters a message began appearing on the screen:

System Initializing…

Beginning Integration of Planet Sol-3 (Local Designation: Earth)

Please Stand By…

“What the fuck?” The words slipped out of Marcus’s mouth unconsciously as he read the messages that began appearing on the screen. The whole thing looked like some sort of boot up sequence. [It stayed directly in the center of his field of vision no matter how he turned.] And the whole message was just mind boggling. Multiverse System? Mana? Integration? What did any of that even mean? Was he losing his mind? Having some sort of weird mental break? Having a stroke?

Beginning Mana Adaption…
Welcome to the Multiverse.

Marcus had just enough time to register the two new lines on the screen before a sensation of falling overtook him. He was unconscious before he hit the floor of elevator.</Text>

            <Title>Physical Evaluation - Agility</Title>
            <Text>Abruptly the world around Marcus changed. He found himself on a small platform, enclosed by walls on three sides. From the back wall to the edge of the platform he had maybe three meters, and beyond that open air with what looked like a series of round concrete pillars with flat tops that looked to be about 30 centimeters in diameter. The poles were spaced out evenly with what looked to be somewhere between two and three meters between them.  There were six such poles between him and another platform.
He moved to the edge of the platform and looked down. The floor was between two and two and half meters down and covered in what looked like sand. While that was a distance that probably wouldn’t result in life threatening injuries, it would still hurt like a bitch if he landed wrong. Clearly the goal here was to use the tops of the poles to traverse the gap without falling. The distance between poles was a bit intimidating, but this first obstacle didn’t seem impossible.
Rather than take a run up, Marcus moved close to the edge and focused on where he was going to land before executing a standing jump with what he thought would be enough effort. The moment he launched himself forward he realized he’d made a mistake. He landed with too much forward momentum to easily stop, but not enough to simply hop to the next pole. As his feet struck the top of the pole, he bent his legs and hips to absorb the impact, but his body rolled forward, pitching him off the pole. He immediately tucked his chin against his chest and threw his weight into the roll. He needed to rotate far enough to get his legs back under him before he hit the ground or he was going to really hurt himself.
Time seemed to slow to a crawl as he felt his body pivot through space. Moments before his impact on the sand, his feet got back under him and he turned his forward motion into a shoulder roll when his feet touched the sand. He spread the impact as he bled the momentum off. The sand kept him from rolling back to his feet, being deeper and dryer than he had feared, which left him lying on his back with some of the air knocked out of him.
A moment later, he found himself standing back on the platform where he began, with no sign of having landed in the sand other than feeling slightly winded from the landing.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Safe Fall (Tier 1) Level 1! 

“Well, at least you can land without injury.” The Guide commented from beside him. “Please try again.”
Marcus nodded, deciding that he needed a slightly different approach. He recalled crossing streams as teen, hopping from one unsteady rock to another without really stopping. That technique seemed much more likely to work here. So he positioned himself a couple paces from the edge and began moving, springing forward and landing with one foot on the first pole before letting the momentum carry him forward to the next with the opposite foot. He repeated this process as he crossed each pole, loosing some of his momentum with each of his hopping steps. As he pushed off the last pole, he knew he wasn’t quite going to make that last distance. Without really thinking he rotated his body, moving his upper body forward and shifting toward a horizontal position, extending his arms.
Way back in his junior high gym classes, Marcus had been taught how to vault during a section on basic gymnastics. Somehow, his body seemed to remember it better than he did. The shift in position resulted in his hands [planting on the platform a short distance past the edge of the platform.] Using the contact, he further rotated his body, bring himself up over the edge and rolling onto the platform. Exhilaration flooded him and he couldn’t help but whoop in pure joy. That had been fun! A little scary, sure, but fun.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Freerunning (Tier 1) Level 1! Agility has increased by 1!

“Acceptably done.” The Guide commented from beside him.
The remainder of the evaluation cycle went much the same as he spent the next few hours working his was through the course. After the second obstacle, which was a more advanced version of the first, with more poles offset from each other instead of in a straight line, the Guide began instructing him in some basic technique where his own attempts fell short. Until, finally, he gained the skill they were trying to impart.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Athleticism (Tier 1) Level 1! Agility, Strength and Endurance have each increased by 1!
Rest period duration remaining: 0:14:59

Instantly finding himself back in the room from his first evaluation, Marcus relaxed and settled into a seated position on the floor. Rather than trying to parse through the System notifications he’d been ignoring, he brought up his status screen to see his progress so far.

So far, this evaluation had resulted in gaining a point of strength and three points each of agility and endurance with attendant gains of 30 vitality and 23 stamina. That seemed pretty good so far, but made him wonder what was up next.
The Guide spoke up before he could ask. “Your gains so far have met expectations. The next cycle will focus on strength through the lifting, carrying and dragging of dead weight. The first step of the evaluation will be a series of deadlifts to establish your maximum lifting capability. The second step will be lifting and carrying a large weighted object a distance of 20 meters. This, too, will be repeated until the object becomes too heavy to carry the full distance. The final step will be dragging an object with a drag line attached. The object will grow heavier every meter it is dragged. The test will be complete when you can no longer move the object.”
“Two hours are allocated to complete this evaluation, however you may rest no more than 15 minutes between tests and once all three tests are complete you may use any remaining time as a rest period, though no questions will be answered until the full cycle is complete.” The Guide paused. “I would recommend meditation between tests to maximize recovery in your case.”
Marcus nodded and settled into a brief meditation to prepare for the first test. </Text>

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five

Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                 Chapter Two

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert
&gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the
word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit
&gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this
feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact).

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 5

reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>Apocalypse Now-ish</Title>
            <Text>Marcus spent some time in the hotel concourse people watching before heading to his room. There was something appealing about the strange slice of the world that was a Las Vegas resort hotel and casino. Some people were busy throwing money away in the hopes of striking it rich. Others were just smiling and pretending they didn’t hate their jobs as they dealt with stuck up pricks. He watched some couples argue about who’s fault it was as they lost more money than they could afford and watched others embrace in celebration as they won big. After about half an hour, he felt his phone vibrate with a text message and fished it out to see it was an apology from Craig, who asked for a week to come up with a counter to Jimmy’s offer. Marcus replied that he had until the day he was back from this trip to make a solid offer before turning his phone completely off and putting it away. 
He pushed himself to his feet, feeling his leg complain again at the motion. He leaned heavily on his cane as he made his way to a nearby VIP elevator and tapped his room card to the access reader. He once again thanked his own foresight for splurging on the VIP package as trudging back to the main elevators definitely did not appeal at the moment. It was past time to get up to his room and soak his aching joints. A few short moments later, the elevator door slid open with a soft ding and Marcus slipped inside. He tapped his room card on the inside control panel and slumped against the side of the elevator. The doors closed with a second soft ding and he felt the elevator smoothly rise up its shaft.
He smiled as the silence of the elevator car enveloped him, the first real silence he’d experienced in who knew how many hours. Then, after a scant handful of floors, the lights in the elevator flickered and died, plunging the enclosed space into complete darkness as the machine stopped dead in its tracks.
“What the hell?” Marcus muttered aloud into the darkness. “A power outage shouldn’t have killed the emergency lights too.” 
Standing up straighter and leaning on his cane, Marcus turned toward the elevator’s control panel and began feeling around blindly for the emergency button. If nothing else, he needed to notify someone that he was trapped.
Suddenly, what looked like a holographic computer screen appeared floating in front of him in the pitch black space. In glowing letters a message began appearing on the screen:

System Initializing…
Attention denizens of the Milky Way: your universe has evolved sufficient sapient life for integration into the Multiverse System.  
Beginning Analysis: Planet Sol-3 (Local Designation: Earth)
Single World Technological Civilization identified… 
Warning: Planet size insufficient for sapient population — Terraforming required.
Warning: Mana density insufficient for normal integration — local mana flow increase required.
Warning: Local sapients not evolved for proper mana use — individual mana adaptaion required.

Preparing Mana Adaptation process… Adaptation duration 20 hours
Preparing System Introduction… Introduction duration 120 hours
Preparing System Tutorials… Tutorial duration 2160 hours
Beginning Integration of Planet Sol-3 (Local Designation: Earth)

Please Stand By…

“What the fuck?” The words slipped out of Marcus’s mouth unconsciously as he read the messages that began appearing on the screen. The whole thing looked like some sort of boot up sequence. [It stayed directly in the center of his field of vision no matter how he turned.] And the whole message was just mind boggling. Multiverse System? Mana? Integration? What did any of that even mean? Was he losing his mind? Having some sort of weird mental break? Having a stroke?

Beginning Mana Adaption…
Welcome to the Multiverse.

Marcus had just enough time to register the two new lines on the screen before a sensation of falling overtook him. He was unconscious before he hit the floor of elevator.</Text>

            <Title>Path Selection - Class</Title>
            <Text>“Welcome to the final part of the Introduction: selecting your path,” his Guide said with a broad smile. “As you have demonstrated exceptional abilities in multiple areas during the course of this introduction, you will be permitted to select both a class and a profession before the beginning of the tutorial. Additionally your options will be of higher quality and tailored to your performance in the introduction instead of being selected from the general starting list.” She paused and allowed that to sink in. “Do you have any questions related to this process?”
“Uh… not that I can think of, unless you can offer any advice on how to choose?” Marcus answered, hoping he wouldn’t end up with so many good options he ended up paralyzed by indecision.
“The only advice I can offer is to chose the option that feels the most true to who you are and want to be,” she answered. “Do you wish to choose class or profession first? Or do you need to a moment to consider?”
“Give me a moment,” he replied automatically, “But do not let me waste more than ten minutes overthinking this.”
“Ten minutes begins now,” she agreed with a nod.
Marcus pulled up his status screen and begin looking it over, wanting to be sure he knew his strongest and weakest points before he started looking at his available paths.

His willpower and luck were ridiculous, as was his mana pool. The rest of his stats were pretty comparable with strength on the low end and wisdom at the high end of the pack. Choosing a magically focused class and profession were obvious no-brainers. In terms of skills, his Pain Resistance, Mana Control and Stealth were the clear stand-outs, though he wasn’t nearly masochistic enough to pick a path that required that much Pain Resistance unless it was just too damn good to pass up. Of course, how could he even tell how good a class or profession was? That was a damn good question.
“How can I tell how good a class or profession is?” he asked, breaking the silence that had fallen for the last couple minutes.
“Each path will have a rarity listed. The rarity goes from inferior at the low end to mythical at the high end,” the Guide answered. “The rarer a path is, the higher the minimum requirements to be offered the path and the more potentially powerful it is. However, the more powerful a path is, the more likely it is to have restrictions or limitations that will make it more challenging to advance. The path descriptions will give you more information and contain hints about limitations and restrictions.”
“Okay, then I will select my class first.” He decided after a few more moments of consideration. Then he could pick a profession to complement his class choice. A menu of six options appeared for him to peruse, which he considered one at a time.

Arcane Marksman (Uncommon) - As one excelling in both ranged combat and mana manipulation, it’s only natural to work to combine the two. This class focuses on using physical ranged weapons and imbuing their attacks with mana for greater effect. 
Primary stats: Wisdom, Dexterity. 
Stat bonuses per tier: +1 Wisdom, +1 Dexterity, + 1 Free point 
Core skills: Marksmanship, Mana Manipulation/Control, [Choice of Ranged Weapon], Imbue Mana (Destructive) 
One additional skill choice at Level 15. 

That was a fairly low rarity class with a decent concept. The classic image of a magical archer raining down powerful magic arrows on their foes was a pretty common archetype. The stats were focused on his what he was already strong at and he even had a jump on two of the core skills for the first tier. But… it just didn’t speak to him. This was a class focused on a pretty specific subset of magic that would be mostly focused through a ranged weapon like a bow or something. That’s not really what he wanted.

Aspiring Mage (Uncommon) - A class focused entirely on the study and use of magic. Poor in physical combat and the use of armor or weapons other than their spells or the occasional mana weapon. This type of Magus specializes in unaspected mana, leaving them rather weak against mana resistance. 
Primary stats: Wisdom, Intelligence. 
Bonus stats per tier: +1 Wisdom, +2 Free points
Core skills: Mana Manipulation/Control, Mana Theory, Mana Bolt, Mana Barrier, Mana Amplification
One additional skill choice every tenth level.

This was definitely more what he had in mind. A classic beginning wizard. The rarity was still low and the focus on unaspected mana could be crippling with its lack of options for more physical combat. It also only provided him one skill he didn’t already have and two more as he leveled up. He preferred it to the Arcane Marksman, but only just. There had to be something better. 

Prodigious Sniper (Rare) - You have a tremendous innate talent killing things from as far away as possible coupled with the skills needed to get into that range without being noticed and get back out again. Your enemies tend to die without ever knowing what killed them.
Primary stats: Dexterity, Agility
Bonus stats per tier: +2 Dexterity, +2 free points
Core skills: Marksmanship, Stealth, [Choice of Ranged Weapon], Extended Range, Power Shot, Sneak Attack
One additional skill choice every tenth level.

He probably should have expected that something like that, but it still caught him off guard. It was definitely a solid class, aside from its complete and total disregard of his skill with mana. Four stat points, four new skills, and two extra skills as he leveled certainly gave it a strong toolkit to work from. But, he was going to give it a hard pass. It strayed into a part of his life he was happy to have left behind. 

Novice Shadow Mage (Rare) - Your skill at stealth and talent for magic makes for a powerful combination. By studying the concepts of shadow and darkness and fusing them into your spell work, you on the path to becoming something to truly fear. Your spells can conceal as easily as they devour the very vitality from your foes. 
Primary stats: Wisdom, Willpower
Bonus stats per tier: +2 Wisdom, +1 Willpower, +1 free point
Core skills: Shadow or Darkness Affinity, Mana Theory, Mana Manipulation or Control, Black Bolt (evolved from Mana Bolt), Black Barrier (evolved from Mana Barrier), Steal Vitality
One additional skill choice every tenth level.

Okay, that was a bit more ominous than he was really looking for but it played heavily into his strengths for controlling mana and stealth. It would evolve two of his skills into, presumably, better versions, moved away from unaspected mana and gave him an ability he assumed would let him recover vitality by stealing it from his foes. It was more tempting than he would like really, but shadows and darkness? Those were not exactly the powers wielded by heroes in most stories. Only, this wasn’t a story and this was clearly a class with great potential power. But he had two more options to consider before deciding…

Prodigious Novice Spellslinger (Epic) - Your skill with mana is truly prodigious and you take full advantage of it, focusing on squeezing every advantage out of your talents. You study magic as intensely as any Wizard, but you strip your spells down to their most efficient forms. Why waste mana on guiding the spell to its target when you’re already a superlative marksman without the help? Few walk the path of the Spellslinger, but those who do follow the path of legends.
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Dexterity, Willpower
Bonus stats per tier: +2 Wisdom, +2 Dexterity, +1 free point
Core skills: Mana Control, Marksmanship, Mana Theory, Mana Amplification, Extend Range, Spell Creation, Spell Adaptation
One additional skill at 5th level, 10th level, and 20th Level

Now that was a helluva class. It checked all the right boxes: focused on magic, leans into his strengths, includes a skill that makes it easier to create new spells, and one to adapt existing spells. That was 5 stat points, 7 skills and 3 skill choices as he leveled. And all without the creepy implications of a focus on shadows and darkness. And he still had one more class of at least the same rarity to consider…

Prophesied Warmage of the Elder Dragons (Legendary) - Your coming was foretold by the most powerful sages of dragon-kind. A being descended from dragons and destined to shake the Multiverse with the full might of his draconic ancestors. Your path will lead you to the very pinnacle of power in the cosmos, if you have the strength to walk it. This class draws its might from the deepest concepts of dragons and the magics they wield.
Primary Stats: Wisdom, Willpower, Endurance
Bonus stats per tier: + 2 Wisdom, +2 Willpower, + 3 free points
Core skills: Mana Control, Mana Theory, Dragon Scales, Dragon Breath, Dragon Wings, Dragon Claws, Draconic Aura, Mana Amplification, Spell Creation  
One additional skill on selection, one additional skill every 5 levels

Marcus stared dumbly at the description for a long while. That was… incredible. Seven stat points per tier, seven new skills with five being directly related to dragons, plus one more selected skill right away and four selected skills as he leveled. Legendary really, truly did seem like an apt description. He would genuinely have to be crazy not to take it, wouldn’t he?
“I choose Prophesied Warmage of the Elder Dragons,” he said aloud, barely hesitating.

Skill Choices available!
Select one of the following skills: Imbue Mana (Destructive), Extend Range, Spell Adaptation, Dragon Fire

Well, this wasn’t exactly the easy choice he’d hoped it would be. He promptly ignored Imbue Mana (Destructive) as he had a pretty good idea of what it did from the context in which he’d seen it before. He needed more information about these other skills though, so he focused on Extend Range first and tried to use Identify on it. To his delighted surprise, it worked! 

Skill: Extend Range (Common)
This skill passively increases the base range increment of all skills and abilities without increasing mana cost. Amount of increase is dependent on skill tier, level, and intelligence.

And it was exactly as boring as he thought it would be. Useful sure, but low rarity and there was just nothing interesting about it. So he moved on to the next one.

Skill: Spell Adaptation (Epic)
This skill allows the user to alter the effects of a spell he is using on the fly. This can include changing almost any aspect of the spell, including imbuing it with concepts not normally associated with it, removing concepts that are part of its normal function and even rendering designated individuals unaffected by the spell. Mana cost varies based on the changes made. 

Now that was a much more interesting skill. It would allow him to tinker will spells he already possessed as he cast them. Great for surprising an enemy or dealing with the unexpected as it arose.  But now for the skill that really tickled his imagination.

Skill: Dragon Fire (Ancient)
This skill grants the user innate insights into the concepts of both normal fire and dragon fire, The power of dragon fire is not to be underestimated as there is nothing it cannot burn and consume. This skill makes it possible to imbue any mana with the aspects of fire or dragon fire and greatly reduces the mana expenditure to imbue either of these concepts into a spell. Grants affinity to both fire and dragon fire. Dragon fire is compatible with all other elemental affinities and can be imbued into those elemental affinities to massively increase damage.

And that was a choice made, “I choose dragon fire.” Now he just hoped his own elemental affinity wasn’t something lame like water. Now to check out the rest of his new class skills.

Skill: Dragon Scales (Ancient)
Renowned for their strength, resilience and resistance to most magic, Dragon Scales are all the protection a true dragon really needs. You have chosen to follow in their footsteps, tapping into the very concept of Dragon Scales to turn your skin into a protective layer of Dragon Scales. For a small expenditure of mana, your skin turns into scales capable of deflecting physical blows and magic alike. While these are not yet the scales of a true dragon, they provide excellent protection and will continue to improve as your understanding of the concept deepens. Maintaining Dragon Scales slowly depletes your Soul Stability until they are dismissed as they are not yet fully part of you. May be dismissed at any time without cost. If damaged an additional small expenditure of mana will repair them. 

The ability to cover his skin in dragon scales to protect himself was going to be an incredible boon in combat. He activated the skill and watched as his skin was covered in scales that gleamed in colors ranging from a glossy chocolate brown to shiny metallic black. He moved around, bending and twisting, testing his flexibility and finding it completely unimpeded by the change. “Oh, I think I really like this,” he muttered aloud. 
“A Legendary class tied to the legacy of true dragons,” the Guide sounded almost awed as it looked him over. [“That is… beyond impressive.] However, time moves on swiftly and you have yet to select a profession.”[MARTY?]
“Oh… yeah. Sorry, got kinda caught up in how badass this class is and forgot,” Marcus admitted sheepishly before dismissing the scales. The vanished instantly, but he noticed that his patches of natural scales had spread somewhat and now reflected the same glossier colorations as his conjured scales. Interesting.

            <Title>Physical Evaluation - Endurance</Title>
            <Text>Initiating Second Evaluation in 0:09:59

Marcus was startled out of his ruminations on the state of Earth when the ten minute warning notification appeared. As before, the notification had a remarkable effect on the Guide as they froze a moment before it appeared and did not resume until after he had read the entire message.
“The second evaluation period is designed to help you acclimate to your body’s new physical limits. As before, it will consist of several evaluation cycles, each of which will be used to push your physical limits in a different way. Unlike the first evaluation period, however, the breaks between evaluation cycles will be only 15 minutes and will include the instructions for your next evaluation cycle.” The Guide [rattled off the explanation smoothly.]
“The first phase of this evaluation will be focused on cardiovascular endurance. When the evaluation cycle begins, this room will be transformed into a running path through a wooded area.” [The Guide continued on with the instructions specific to the first cycle of the evaluation.] “The terrain on this path will include inclines and declines of various degrees, areas where footing may be treacherous, and other simple obstacles that will require close attention to navigate. Both temperature and humidity on the track will be increased to further increase the intensity of the evaluation.”
“Finally, this is a long distance run, not a short sprint. If your running pace slows to a point where you cannot complete the minimum acceptable distance in the time allotted for this evaluation you will be warned,” she cautioned, her tone turning grim. “After the third warning you will punished for running too slow.”
Well, didn’t that sound fun. “Punished how?” He wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to know, but finding out when it happened seemed worse than knowing ahead of time.
“Pain.” She answered bluntly. “You will feel steadily increasing pain until your running speed is back up to a point where you can complete the course in the remaining time. It is therefore highly recommended that you push yourself as hard as you can, keeping in mind that your body’s physical limits have been improved significantly by the Mana Adaptation process.”
Great. He had to run an unknown distance in an unspecified amount of time in an evaluation clearly intended to push his endurance to its absolute limit. Marcus hadn’t gone running in more than 20 years courtesy of the injury that the System only healed 30-odd hours ago. At least his pain tolerance was good, because he had a feeling it was going to be tested vigorously by this event, one way or another.

Initiating Second Evaluation in 0:02:23
Manifesting Evaluation Course in 0:01:53

Marcus began stretching vigorously to warm up his muscles. The last thing he needed was a cramp. As he did so, he mentally reviewed everything Basic Combat training for the Army had taught him about safe, efficient running form. The provided sandals would be crap for running in compared to proper running shoes, providing no support to speak of. He paused and tightened the sandal straps to ensure he didn’t lose a shoe on the course and then checked the sole of the shoe to judge how much traction he could expect. Thankfully, the soles were roughened leather, so it wouldn’t be too bad as long as his path didn’t track through soft mud or wet stone.

Manifesting Evaluation Course.
Initiating Second Evaluation in 0:00:29

In between one heartbeat and the next the room around him was simply gone. Instead he stood on a dirt path less than a meter wide in a quiet wood. Behind him, the path ended abruptly in a steep drop off, making it quite obvious which direction to run.  Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he took a long moment to finish preparing. The path ahead sloped gently upward in the distance, but was pretty well flat for a good long while here at the start, so at least that wouldn’t be too bad.
When the countdown hit five seconds, the Guide spoke from somewhere behind him. “On your mark… get set… go!” 
The last word hit precisely on zero and Marcus pushed off hard, accelerating quickly. He wasn’t sprinting because that would be pretty stupid, but he was extending his stride and aiming for a strong pace from the start. To his great surprise, it was considerably easier than he remembered running ever being before his accident. To be fair, Marcus had never enjoyed running because it had always been painful. Now, however, it was not painful at all. He stretched out his stride, concentrating on all the tips and techniques he’d been taught for running during his time in the military. 

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Running (Tier 1) Level 1! Agility has increased by 1!

Marcus willed away his notifications and continued to push himself, picking up his pace and focusing on controlling his breathing. Except, he wasn’t only inhaling air, he was also pulling in mana. Mana that he was naturally circulating through body. Mana that was rejuvenating him and refreshing his muscles. He sped up further, obeying the Guide’s advice to push himself as hard as he could. He needed to find his limits so that he could also find his sustainable maximum speed. He willed away the notifications of his running skill increasing, paying them little mind. 

Congratulations! Beginner Running (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Running (Tier 2) Level 1! Endurance and Agility have each increased by 1!

Now, the notification of his skill evolving and increasing two of his stats, that did pop up.  Increasing stats was a surprising side effect and made him smile even as he kept pushing along at the best speed he could maintain. And the evaluation just kept going, stretching on beyond the end of the first hour with no end in sight. By the end of that first hour, he had well and truly found the limit of his sustainable pace. His pace was chewing up the kilometers and he wondered just how fast he actually was running. Not that it really mattered, he’d just have to keep running until the evaluation was over. 

Congratulations! Basic Running (Tier 2) Level 20 has evolved to Novice Running (Tier 3) Level 1! Endurance has increase by 1! This skill cannot evolve further in its current state.

This notification came as a bit of a bigger surprise. Especially, the later portion about the skill not being able to evolve further in its current state. Clearly he would have to do something differently to evolve that skill further, but he had no idea what or how to approach it. He did lean into his increased endurance and push himself further, finding it had slightly improved the pace he could maintain. 
And that was essentially how the remainder of the first phase of the second evaluation proceeded. Hours passed and he kept running without slowing down, let alone stopping. For five full hours he ran, before the phase ended. 

 Current Evaluation Cycle completed.
Rest period duration remaining 0:14:59

Marcus stretched a bit to cool down before asking the Guide a question, “Are all of this evaluation’s cycles going to be like that?”
“Essentially yes,” the Guide replied. “As the first cycle focused on your endurance, the second will focus on agility. This cycle will consist of having to move rapidly through an increasingly complex environment. You will have to learn to trust your body and your sense of space in this cycle.”
“So… parkour?” he asked.
The Guide froze for a moment, the way it occasionally seemed to when it needed to access information from the System. “Yes, the terms parkour or freerunning are applicable to this portion of the evaluation.”
“And if I have no idea how to do anything resembling parkour or freerunning?” Marcus frowned. He’d watched freerunning videos a few times, but there was a huge difference between seeing it and doing it.
“If you haven’t progressed satisfactorily during the first hour, then the remainder of the period will be spent with me providing basic instruction until either the time elapses or you show sufficient proficiency to no longer need instruction.” The Guide replied. “In the meantime, trust your body.

            <Text>Marcus woke up slowly, his head feeling as though it were wrapped in wool. His mouth was dry and he felt cold tile beneath his bare back. Which made no sense as the last thing he remembered was being in a carpeted elevator and wearing his vest and a tee shirt. He groggily opened his eyes only to be confronted with yet another screen in the center of his vision.

Welcome to the Multiverse.
Mana adaptation process successful!
Unexpected race evolution detected! 
Customizing Introduction sequence…
Initializing Introduction, please stand by…
Introduction period begins in 0:59:59

Beyond the semi-transparent screen, he could see that he was lying on his back staring up at a white ceiling. The room was well lit, but with no clear source of illumination. 
Groaning, he forced himself to a sitting position, which allowed him to take in the rest of the room he was in. The room was entirely white and completely empty aside from himself. Smooth white ceiling and walls, cold white tile floor. Even the light in the room seemed to be a soft white color. No distinguishing features anywhere that he could he see.
And he was naked. No sign of his clothes, his phone, his cane or even an entrance to the strange room. He rubbed his hands over his face and frowned. The skin on his face felt… different. Strange. There were patches on his cheeks and brow around his eyes that felt rough and almost scaly. He frantically felt around the rest of his face, and thankfully nothing else there felt wrong. Then he looked at the rest of his body, noticing patches of dark brown to almost black scales on his torso, arms and legs. 
“What the ever-loving fuck!” he scrambled to his feet in a panic.
And that wasn’t all, his fingers were slightly longer and more slender than he remembered and tipped in hard sharp talons. His toes were tipped in somewhat shorter versions of the same. Even the skin that wasn’t scaly looked rougher and had darkened somewhat to an almost sandy tan color. 
And his body, aside from his face and head, was hairless!
“Your mana adaptation activated dormant traits in your pattern,” a calm, feminine voice said from behind him. “This resulted in changes to your physical and metaphysical bodies.”
Marcus whirled to find a tall, slender woman behind him where no one had been moments before. Like him, she had patches of scales around her eyes, on her forehead and down the visible portions of her arms. Unlike him, her scales were the vibrant green of living vegetation. He also noticed her eyes resembled those of a snake or lizard, with a vertical slit instead of a round pupil.
It was at this point that he realized the screen he’d been seeing had vanished. “What the hell! What’s going on here?” he gasped out, instinctively covering his dangly bits with his hands at seeing the woman. “Where am I? Where are my clothes? Who are you?” His heart was hammering in his chest
“What’s going on is your universe is being integrated into the Multiverse by the System. You are currently in the Introduction sequence, an experience intended to help you understand the changes to your world and prepare you for the tutorial.” She spoke in that same calm, even tone, showing no emotional reaction to his outburst.  “Your clothes and belongings were destroyed by exposure to the intense mana required to trigger your mana adaptation. And I am your Guide to the Introduction.”

            <Text>Rest period duration remaining 0:09:59

The Guide stiffened and began explaining the final evaluation cycle. “This final cycle will be focused on your willpower and ability to concentrate on a single task without distraction.” She paused, clearly receiving information from the System. “In your case, this task will be complicated by the fact that you will need to use your mana control as well.”
“When the test begins, a sphere of mana aspected to the concepts of heaviness and solidity will form just below the ceiling. Your task is to focus your mana control and keep that sphere from hitting the floor.”
Marcus blinked. “I assume this will be harder than it sounds?”
“Most likely yes. It will be roughly akin to lifting a solid object with nothing but your will and your mana control.” She nodded. “Further, as time goes on, the environment around you will produce distractions in an attempt to break your concentration. Any other questions?”
“What happens when it inevitably does hit the floor?”
“Then it will vanish and reappear near the ceiling so you can try again.”
“And when I reach mental exhaustion?” 
“Then you will begin the second phase of this cycle: resistance training.”
“Resisting what exactly?” He asked hesitantly.
“Pain,” she replied bluntly. “Pain resistance is the only passive way to test or improve willpower, a fact you should be well aware of given the strength of your will at this point.”
Marcus groaned aloud. “I was afraid you were gonna say that.”
He settled into his meditation position and focused his mana senses on the ceiling, waiting for the sphere to manifest. After a few minutes, he received a notification as the sphere began to coalesce. 

Beginning Final Evaluation Cycle.
Current Cycle duration remaining 05:59:59

Concentrating, he focused his will on the sphere, trying to infuse it with his intent only to find that the sphere resisted. Fuck! If he had to try to fight through that much resistance, his mental energy wouldn’t last long at all. He needed another idea. Releasing his will, he pushed his senses into the sphere, trying to understand it. Its aspects made it feel like a solid object to his mana senses. And he abruptly felt it begin to fall. It didn’t fall as fast as he feared it would, because it only had a semblance of mass rather the reality of it. 
He needed something to catch it with… something else with a similar sense of solidity. He mimicked the feel of the sphere and envisioned a cupped hand beneath the sphere, holding it up. Quickly, he gathered mana into his imagined hand, infused it with the barest modicum of his will,  and pushed upward against the sphere. The hand was just solid enough and managed to slow the descent, but not stop it. He gathered more mana, increasing the solidity of his mental construct and increasing his infusion of will by the tiniest increments he could manage until the sphere drifted to a stop a scant three feet from the floor.

Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Telekinesis (Tier 1) Level 1! Willpower has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Concentration (Tier 1) Level 1! Willpower has increased by 1!

He suppressed a grin. If this was all he had to do then this would be a lot easier than the Guide made it sound, he could hold this almost indefinitely. The strain on his willpower and ability to focus were so slight it didn’t feel like he was expending any mental energy at all. In fact, it required so little energy that he was easily able to raise his telekinetic hand and lift the sphere back to the ceiling effortlessly.
Which was when the sphere began to slowly solidify further and become heavier, gradually increasing the strain. He could feel his new skills improving as he both refined his mental construct to reduce the amount of energy it required and tightened his focus on the task at hand. And that’s when his concentration was further tested as he felt a sharp stab of pain, as if he had been very quickly pricked with a pin. The distractions, it appeared, had begun.
So it continued for hours, the pinpricks coming in completely random locations at completely random moments as the sphere got heavier and more solid all the time. He gradually began to lose ground with sphere, as it slowly sank in response to his flagging mental energy. That didn’t mean he wasn’t making progress though.

Congratulations! Beginner Telekinesis (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Telekinesis (Tier 2) Level 1! Willpower has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Beginner Concentration (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Concentration (Tier 2) Level 1! Willpower has increased by 1!
Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Pain Resistance (Tier 1) Level 1! Willpower has increased by 1!

Marcus grit his teeth and focused on pushing back. He had been pushing through pain and exhaustion with nothing but his stubbornness and willpower for decades. He wasn’t about to give up now. He hardened his will, refusing to bend to the challenge. Abruptly he felt his loss of mental energy slow considerably as will seemed to separate from his concentration. 

Congratulations! You have learned to separate your willpower from your mental focus and feel them as two separate forces!
You have earned the title ‘Iron Will’. Title increases willpower by an additional 20% and using will no longer results in mental fatigue.
Congratulations! Basic Concentration (Tier 2) Level 6 has evolved to Basic Mental Focus (Tier 2) Level 12! Intelligence has increased by 1!

His focus faltered for a moment before steadying again. He appeared to have separated his ability to concentrate from his willpower, tying his ability to focus intently to his intelligence instead and improving it a lot in the process. Even so, he felt his renewed mental energy draining. But if his willpower no longer expended mental energy… then could he overcome the sphere’s intent without exhausting himself?
He focused on the sphere and gradually shifted his will from his telekinetic hand to the sphere itself, forcing his intent for it remain where it was into the mana it was made of. It resisted, but Marcus did not relent. Finally, just as he felt his telekinetic hand faltering as his mental energy was exhausted, the sphere gave way before his will and the sphere froze in place, as unmoving as his will.

Congratulations! You have overcome a willpower of a significantly higher tier than you!
You have earned the title ‘Titan’s Will’. Title increases willpower by an additional 10% and greatly reduces the natural suppressive effect of higher tier presences.

As exhaustion overtook him and he sank into unconsciousness, Marcus couldn’t help but smile at his accomplishment. [Getting dangerously close to a Marty Stu…]</Text>

Marcus brought his focus back to the present. Goals were all well and good, but that one was a long way off and he needed to lay a foundation for it here and now. He needed his head in the game. “What’s the deal with these training periods you mentioned?”
“Once it begins I will spend the next 10 hours teaching you. We will start with a basic skill everyone in the Multiverse learns and from there, it will be up to you. Most use their first training period to get System recognition of skills they already possess and their second to learn things they think will help them survive in the post-System world.”
“Okay, one last question before we run out of time then, how does one increase their race tier?” He asked.
“By walking their path,” she answered. “This means progressing in both your class and profession as well as your overall level. Your race tier is limited by all three. Once you have raised your class and profession to the next tier and have enough levels, you’ll receive a quest to complete to raise your race tier.”
“So, 10 levels and get my profession and class to tier 2 and then I can raise my race tier?”
“No. 20 levels not 10.” She corrected him, before explaining. “These levels work a little differently in two ways. First, they do not reset when your race tier increases. Second, you need to gain ten times as many levels as the tier you’re trying to reach.”
“So level 20 for tier 2, level 30 for tier 3?” He hoped that’s what she meant, but was pretty sure that it was not going to be that easy.
“No. Level 2o for tier 2, level 50 for tier 3, level 90 for tier 4, level 140 for tier 5, and so on until you reach the tier 9 at level 440,” she gave him a sympathetic look. “And then you would still need 100 more levels to begin to seek godhood.”
“Well, that certainly explains why it takes so long to reach godhood,” he said with a grimace. “I also assume each level is harder to get than the one before it?”
“Yes. You only gain experience toward your level by facing a legitimate challenge, such as killing a beast close to you in level, or using your profession to craft something appropriate to your level. Repeating the same tasks, such as slaying the same kind of beast repeatedly will eventually begin to result in diminishing returns.”
“Yay,” he replied unenthusiastically. 
“On the other hand, constantly seeking new and interesting challenges and pushing your limits result in the best gains,” she said reassuringly.
“Complacency bad, novelty good,” he joked. “Got it.”
“Essentially yes.”

Final Training Period duration remaining 09:59:59

“In order to use the identify skill, you must first focus your attention on the thing you want to identify. You must be able to see it with your perception skill as well as your mana sense,” the Guide began explaining. “Think of it as seeing all of the thing in question, both its physical and metaphysical existence. Once you can get a glimpse of that gestalt, the System will step in provide you additional information, unlocking the beginner level of the identify skill.”
The Guide waved a hand and the staff Marcus had used earlier appeared on the ground in front of him. “Use this to work on the technique, it’s not as easy as it sounds.”
Marcus did as instructed, focusing his full attention on the staff without touching it. This skill was focused on seeing, not on tactile contact after all. He spent several minutes staring intently at the object, seeing the mana construct inside it as if it were overlaid on it. 
“You’re trying too hard,” the Guide chided gently. “Relax your focus. Think of this as more of taking a quick snapshot of the object than trying to paint a portrait of it in your head.”
He forced himself to relax and close his eyes for a few moments. Then he tried again, focusing both his eyes and mana senses simultaneously this time. This time, instead of seeing one aspect of it overlaid with the other, he saw it as one complete object. There was more to its mana than just the construct he’d seen before. Aspects of the staff that were lost when he looked too closely. Abruptly he got a System notification.

Inferior Wizard Staff (Tier 1)
Requirements to use: Level 1 or higher in any sapient race or Mana manipulation (Tier 1) Level 1 or higher.
Wielder can charge the staff with mana to create a bolt of destructive mana that can be fired at will. Additional mana may be used to either increase the damage inflicted or the effective range up to a limit of 10 mana per tier of the staff. Each mana dedicated to increasing the range will extend the range by one increment. Each mana dedicated to damage increases the damage inflicted by one increment. Damage type determined by aspect of mana used.
Range increment:  150 meters
Congratulations! Skill Learned: Beginner Identify (Tier 1) Level 1!

The Guide blinked. “Well, that didn’t take as long as expected.” She shook her head. “Expert titles must have lowered the threshold for the System assist to kick in. So what shall we work on next?”
The next several hours were spent on gaining system recognition for the stalking and fieldcraft abilities he had previously learned on the sniper course, the unarmed combat skills he picked up in basic training and various martial arts classes he took, and his skill at using a staff in melee. That was followed up with some additional training in mana theory and meditation that led into the Guide’s assistance in creating an spell to shield himself from both physical and magical attack.

Final Training period duration remaining: 0:59:59
Initiating Tutorial period in 2:29:59

“You have almost an hour of training time remaining. Would you like to work on anything else?” The Guide asked.
“Can you provide me with a bunch of items so I can work on my Identify skill?” 
“Certainly.” She waved her hand and more than a dozen items appeared: an assortment of small weapons, jewelry, pieces of armor made of leather or metal, and small bottles of liquid.
With a smile, Marcus reached out with his telekinesis skill to lift each item, and bring it closer. Then he would use identify on it and return it to its original position. He largely ignored the information the identify skill provided, since he wasn’t going to be permitted to keep the items, it was just a way to practice two more skills he wanted to improve while he had the opportunity. 
Then he spent the last few minutes practicing with his mana bolt until he received the System notification that marked the end of training.

Final Training period completed.

            <Title>Meditation Mediation</Title>
            <Text>“Meditation?” Marcus asked with a frown. “Is that actually useful? Most of the meditation techniques I’ve encountered seemed focused on achieving mental clarity and relaxation, and I’m not too bad at doing that already.”
“This meditation technique focuses on understanding and using your internal energies. It’s a foundation for more advanced techniques that can speed up body’s recovery processes, leading to regaining Vitality, Stamina, and Mana faster. It also reduces your need to sleep and at higher tiers can replace sleep entirely.” She explained as she assumed a lotus position opposite him.
Marcus considered it briefly before nodding, “Fair enough, please teach me.”
“Very well. As you noted most meditation techniques begin with focusing on emptying your mind and relaxing your body, so too does this technique. Begin with your breathing. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose for a count of four, then hold your breath for a count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for another count of four, and then hold your breath again for a final count of four.  This is the most basic breathing pattern used in meditation. I believe your culture termed it ‘box breathing,’ though the number used can vary.”
Marcus nodded, already very familiar with the process. He smoothly settled into a rhythm, letting his eyes close as the Guide guided him through a meditation exercise. At her instructions, he relaxed each of his muscle groups, one at a time, to immerse himself in a place of peace and tranquility. Which is where the meditation took a turn from what he’d experienced before the System.
“Now, with eyes closed and body relaxed, turn your mana sense inward. Observe the flow of energy into your core as you continue your breathing as before. See how your body doesn’t just circulate the impure energy you breathe in and purify. See how the pure mana from core also circulates through the rest of your body along natural channels. Immerse your senses in that flow of purified mana, not in the process of purification you established during the evaluation, but in the flow of energy from your core, out through the rest of your body. Feel yourself surrounded by that pure mana, feel your consciousness be pulled along with the mana as if you were a leaf carried along on a river.”
He followed her instructions carefully, finding the mana flow he hadn’t even noticed before. It pulled him along, circulating up through his brain to revitalize his mind, then down through his upper torso and into one arm and then back through the upper torso and down into his abdomen. From here it flowed down into one leg, then back up into the abdomen before repeating its path through his other leg, then back into the upper torso. Then it flowed through his remaining arm and back into his core.  It was a continuous unending circuit of power moving through his body. 
“Good,” he heard the Guide speaking softly, “stay within the flow, feel the energy revitalize your body. Each cell siphoning off just enough power to completely fuel and revitalize it. Using that infinitesimal bit of energy to strengthen itself and by extension, you.”
He followed the circulation through his body again, watching more closely. Seeing the energy radiate out from his pathways to super charge his cells. It was as if light itself was spreading outward through his body from his pathways. And yet… it was a stable flow. New mana soaked easily into his core, replacing the miniscule amount of energy being consumed as quickly as it was used. It was an odd sense of homeostasis within the energy flow. 
“Excellent,” the Guide spoke again. “You can maintain this state perpetually at your level of mana control, and from here you can begin to experiment with improving this skill by altering the mana flow. For now, however, lift your senses back out of the mana flow. Slowly! So that you don’t leave yourself disoriented. Once you are fully separated from the flow, you can open your eyes and stop box breathing.”
Marcus opened his eyes to System notifications.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Meditation (Tier 1) Level 1!
…
Congratulations! Beginner Meditation (Tier 1) has improved to Level 10!
Congratulations! Beginner Meditation (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Meditation (Tier 2) Level 1! Wisdom has increased by 1!

“Well done,” the Guide complimented him. “Your previous exposure to the breathing technique and the pre-system meditation techniques seems to have served you well.”
“Thanks.” Marcus replied absently as he thought back over his various skill evolutions. He was noticing a pattern. “Do all Tier 1 skills evolve to Tier 2 at level ten?”
“No. However a skill must reach a minimum of level of ten times their tier before they can be evolved. The actual evolution is a result of your comprehension of the skill or technique you are using. Tier 1 skills, however, are the simplest to learn and evolve, so they only rarely progress much past Level 10 before evolving to the next Tier. As you get into higher Tier skills, that will reach a point where it is extremely rare to see a skill immediately evolve.”
He nodded along with her explanation, feeling like it made perfect sense. As a skill grew in complexity and potential applications, it would get harder to advance them. “Ah, thanks for the clarification. I’ve just been doing well with comprehension and these are low tier skills. Got it.” 
“If you mean you are in the lower tiers of these skill, then you are correct.” The Guide countered his statement. “If you mean these are of limited value, then you are grossly incorrect. Both Mana Control and Meditation are regarded as essential skills throughout the Multiverse for anyone pursuing a path involving magic.”
[While it was obvious why Mana Control would be considered essential, Marcus considered his meditation for a while, pondering her words and why it might be so highly regarded. After a short while, the understanding hit home.] “It’s the ability to study mana flows so deeply while meditating, isn’t it? That makes it easier to grasp concepts related to mana.”
“Essentially yes.” The Guide answered with a nod. “As you sink into deeper states of meditation, your ability to perceive mana interactions and even fundamental concepts grows proportionately.”
He nodded again, grasping the obvious implications. “I guess those hermits on remote mountaintops meditating on the universe and seeking enlightenment were on the right path,” he joked.
“Essentially yes. Though they lacked techniques to truly achieve their goals without the System.”
Marcus rolled his eyes internally as he considered the Guide’s hit and miss ability to recognize his attempts at humor. Then he checked the time remaining before the next evaluation would begin.

Initiating Second Evaluation in 0:51:12

So it had taken around an hour and a half for him to learn meditation, which was a lot longer than it had seemed at the time, but then time was weird that way. Which immediately got him wondering… “Time is a concept, right?”
“Yes.”
“So you can use mana to manipulate Time?” Holy shit, that was a cool idea.
“With sufficient understanding of the concept, yes.” The Guide replied. “Doing so is called Chronomancy and is one of the more complex and esoteric branches of magical study.”
That… was… awesome. And then his rational brain prodded him again. He’d spent the time he was going to use to experiment with mana learning meditation, and he did not feel like 40 minutes was enough time to do anything worthwhile in that regard. So instead, he turned to one last set of questions he had.

            <Title>Adaptation</Title>
            <Text>Marcus found his head spinning. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest as the adrenaline in his system put his brain into what his ex-wife had always called crisis mode. His emotions seemed to shut off, his breathing deepened, and his rational mind took over. 
He analyzed the situation logically and considered what he had experienced so far, taking stock of it all. The strange screens he’d seen. The obvious and palpable changes to his physical body. The complete lack of pain in his leg for the first time in literal decades. The strange woman standing in front of him. [life or death combat situations back when he was a soldier.] None of it made sense.
Could he be suffering some manner of psychotic break? Possibly. However, so far everything was coherent and he could follow both the information provided by the strange screens and the answers provided by the woman. His ability to think and analyze the data he was being given didn’t appear to be impaired, even if the data itself and resulting conclusions were outrageous by any objective standard. That didn’t fit with the fractured reasoning associated with severe mental breaks, did it?
Likewise, the clarity of his thoughts seemed to contradict the possibility he had been drugged or injured. It didn’t fully discount the possibility of hallucinations from some other cause, but again that seemed increasingly unlikely given his ability to even consider that possibility. His general understanding of hallucination suggested that while hallucinating, it was almost impossible to consider that you might be hallucinating. Also, would a hallucination or delusion be so consistent? That didn’t seem probable.
Was he thinking clearly though? He tested himself, running through a set of mathematical calculations he’d had ingrained in his memory for long distance shooting. He didn’t stumble or stutter over any step of the equations, so he could only conclude he was, indeed, thinking clearly. That left him faced with Occam’s Razor: the simplest explanation that fits the facts is the most probable explanation. Therefore, he should proceed from the assumption that this was really happening until something proved it wasn’t.
He considered the woman’s responses. She gave direct answers to the questions he’d posed, without volunteering additional information or providing context. That was not typical human conversational behavior. At the same time, she had interpreted his initial outburst as a question and responded accordingly, indicating that she was capable of grasping and answering implied questions as well. There were no value statements or emotional emphasis on anything she said, which suggested that she answered with what she perceived to be statements of fact rather than opinion. That at least provided a path to acquire more information.
“You’re my guide? What does that mean?” he asked finally.
“I am a System projection intended to help you navigate the changes brought about by the first phase of System integration and to prepare you for the tutorial,” she answered. “That means I am here to answer relevant questions for you, teach you basic conceptual knowledge about the System and the Multiverse it governs, and help you assess options and select a path forward.”
“I see,” he said as he considered her response. “A System projection? Does that mean you aren’t real? You’re a hologram or something?”
“I am not a hologram, I am a material projection. A physical manifestation of a limited set of System functions intended to interact with sapient beings in universes that are being integrated into the Multiverse.”
“But you aren’t a fully sapient being yourself?”
“No. I am not classed as sapient as the System is not classed as sapient. While I have some ability to reason and communicate like sapient beings, I do not have a sense of my self as an individual. I exist to serve a purpose and when that purpose is fulfilled I cease to be.” She paused for a moment as though thinking. “It would be easiest for you to consider me an automaton.”
“Why do you appear to be the same as me? Physically I mean.”
“To make it more comfortable for you to interact with me.” Her slight smile brushed the edge of the uncanny valley. “Most sapients find it easier to interact with other individuals of the same or similar phenotype.”
Marcus nodded at the explanation. It made sense given how humans could hate each other for differences as small as skin color. “Since you’re here to answer questions, what is the System?”
“The System is the manifestation of a confluence of cosmic laws and an interface to interact with fundamental principles of that confluence,” she replied, taking on an almost flat affect with this answer.
“Can you elaborate? What cosmic laws? What fundamental principles?” he pressed.
“No further elaboration available. Details of the System and it’s underlying laws and principles are irrelevant to you at this time,” the flat affect persisted as she continued, “Relevant knowledge of the System will become available as you progress in the Multiverse.”
That caused Marcus to frown. The System clearly limited information, but on what criteria? Why? He considered trying to rephrase the question and press further, but decided to pursue other inquiries first. “Ok, then what is the Multiverse?” 
“The Multiverse is the set of universes which have evolved sufficient sapient life to be integrated into the System.” Her voice shifted once more, back to a more human, for lack of a better word, affect. 
“How many universes are we talking about?” Marcus wasn’t entirely unfamiliar with some of the multiverse theories of reality, but clearly this wasn’t quite the same thing.
“This integration brings the total number of universes in the System to 20.”
“Only 20? That seems much lower than I expected. Why so few?”
“For the System to integrate a universe, that universe must meet a set of specific criteria. This includes sufficient ambient mana levels in the universe, containing a minimum threshold of universe maturation indicated by the amount of recognizable sapient life contained therein, and a certain degree of cosmological proximity to a universe that is already integrated.” She tilted her head as she regarded him. “While countless universes exist, thus far only 20 universes meet all criteria. This number will increase as each new universe that is fully integrated brings additional candidates into cosmological proximity of the System.”
That made sense… sort of. Clearly the System was spreading from some point of origin in the cosmos. Maybe universes spread out from some central point like galaxies did in their universe? “How long has the System been spreading through the cosmos?”
“Approximately 5 billion local years have elapsed since the System was initiated. System initiation resulted in a waveform that propagated through the cosmos and triggered the processes which resulted in the formation of life in compatible universes.” As she answered, her voice reverted to the flat affect she had used before when asked directly about the System.
Marcus blinked. He vaguely recalled that the Earth itself wasn’t even 5 billion years old yet. And the System was initiated? That implied that it didn’t spontaneously come to exist but was somehow created? “Why was the System initiated?” The question sprang off his tongue before he consciously decided to ask it.
“The System was initiated to ensure that life persists in the Multiverse and to stabilize universes where sapience develops while fostering growth and strengthening individual sapient organisms.”
Interesting. That question seemed to get around the limits on questions about the System. So maybe, “how does the System foster growth and strengthen sapient organisms?”
“The System accomplishes these goals by two means: by promoting and rewarding competition between organisms and by infusing all multicellular life with sufficient mana to make significant growth and development possible. The increased mana levels also stabilize stellar activity and extend biological lifespans.”
That was… a lot to digest. Whatever the System was, it didn’t appear to be bad thing based on these explanations. He did still need some clarifications based on the terminology the system used, “and just what is mana?”
The woman’s affect became animated once more as they moved away from discussions directly related to the System itself. “Mana is the most fundamental form of external energy. It can be manipulated and altered by both the environment and by life itself. As an organism becomes able to store and concentrate more mana within themselves, they become both more powerful and less susceptible to damage and thereby more likely to continue living. Your planet’s culture had numerous similar notions such as chi or qi, ki, vitae, and prana, though none of those fully encapsulate what mana truly is, as those terms primarily focus on more internalized functions of mana.”
She had no sooner finished her explanation when she froze and the screen reappeared in front of Marcus.

            <Text>Rest period duration remaining 09:59

Marcus opened his eyes as the Guide woke him from his well earned nap. He sat up and stretched, feeling much improved, but not nearly back to fully rested. At least his resource pools were full and he could string two thoughts together in a way that made sense.
As soon as his eyes focused on her, the Guide began speaking to him. “The next evaluation cycle will be focused on Wisdom. Since you have proven to be a prodigy in Mana Control and have already learned Basic Meditation, your evaluation will be unique to you.”
Marcus’s eyes went wide and he swallowed. He remembered quite well the steep increase in difficulty his final cycle had experienced in the first evaluation for similar reasons. “Okay, how rough is this going to be?”
“You will spend the first portion of the cycle on a complex mana manipulation problem meant to push your understanding of and ability to control mana,” she answered. “The problem will require focus and attention to detail, but is certainly within your demonstrated capabilities. After that, I will spend the remainder of the cycle assisting you with further developing and evolving your meditation technique.”
“That doesn’t sound too bad,” he relaxed a little. “Can you explain the mana problem?”
“I can,” she nodded. “Five mana spheres will manifest in the room, each with a different affinity. You will be given a short window to explore these spheres and identify their affinities. That window will end with a stream of mana being injected into the room. This stream will extremely dense and comprised of mana of all five affinities in randomly varying concentrations. Your task is to separate out the incoming mana into it’s different affinities and feed the appropriate affinity mana to each of the spheres.”
“A mana, sorting problem then?” he clarified.
“Essentially yes,” she nodded. “You will be judged on your ability to correctly funnel mana into the spheres without absorbing and purifying any of the mana meant for the spheres.”
“Oh,” Marcus’s eyes widened somewhat. “So I’m not just sorting the five affinities for the spheres but also moving anything that doesn’t belong to the spheres through my core to purify it… That is a bit more complicated since I will have to consciously monitor my own mana intake as well.” He nodded. “It’s doable though.”
The Guide nodded. “This portion will end when mana remains that matches the affinity of the spheres.”

Rest period duration remaining 0:00:29

Marcus closed his eyes and pushed out with his mana sense until it encompassed the entire room. He sank into a semi-meditative state, with full consciousness directed onto the mana surrounding him. Within a few breaths he felt five intense points blaze into being within the room, each point coalesced into a brilliant sphere of aspected mana about 15 cm in diameter. The spheres drifted on the ambient mana moving lazily about the room rather than remaining fixed in place.
[Quickly Marcus reached out and touched each sphere with his senses one by one. The first was like touching a red hot burner on a stove. It wasn’t fire mana, though. It was something more than just heat or flames… something brighter and sharper. It was radiant affinity mana! The next was sphere was easier, it tasted of ozone, like touching your tongue to a battery. Lightning affinity, definitely. The third was solid and felt like running his fingers through rich loam soil. Earth affinity, which meant he needed to keep it away from the lightning sphere or they would likely explode, discharging all of their mana violently. The fourth sphere was solid and strong, with a sense of… being almost unstoppable. Force affinity, he was sure of it, which meant that sphere probably couldn’t be affected by any other sphere in the room. And the last sphere was cold, dark and hungry trying to absorb every bit of mana it encountered. Dark affinity, which made the whole thing complicated since Dark affinity would consume anything.] [How the heck does he know all this?]
With some gentle nudging from his Mana Control skill, he positioned the spheres around the room, keeping them separated and preparing for the stream to start. As he felt the mana stream begin pouring into the room, Marcus erected two barriers one of dark mana around the dark sphere and one of force mana around himself. Only dark mana could pass through the dark barrier, keeping that sphere from consuming anything but the stream of dark mana he would need to set up.  The force mana would block any mana from reaching him while he got his mana streams organized.
Mentally, he grabbed hold of the incoming mana stream, using his will to pass it through a sieve. He used the sieve to break the stream into its component parts, then began directing the individual streams to the correct spheres. Once he managed that, he infused each stream with yet more of his will, causing each of the streams to begin attracting mana of the same affinity. This caused each stream to begin slurping up any loose mana of its own type and drag that mana along with it into the sphere.
Once that was finally stabilized, he turned to the final part of the problem, dissipating the barrier around himself. Then he began breathing in the mana that was not part of his streams or being attracted by them, cycling that mana through his core and purifying it. As soon as he was sure he had everything moving correctly, he relaxed a little. The difficulty here was setting up the flows and keeping the sieve in place. Maintaining it was like keeping six free-spinning wheels in motion, a quick touch here and there to keep anything from slowing or stopping and everything was good. 
After a small eternity of juggling the mana streams, the incoming flow began to diminish, signaling an end to the flood. This was the final tricky part, as the flow behind the streams began to slacken, risking it all falling apart. So he moved on to his endgame, wrapping each stream with the a thick layer of mana that he’d stripped all the affinities from. He infused this unaspected mana with a sense of solidness to prevent it from being consumed by the aspected mana and used it squeeze the streams. It felt very much like rolling up an almost empty tube of toothpaste to make sure none was wasted.
As the last of the mana from the streams was absorbed, he collapsed the dark mana barrier around it’s sphere and let the sphere consume that mana as well before opening his eyes on his System notifications.

Congratulations! Journeyman Mana Control (Tier 5) has improved to Level 12!
Congratulations! Beginner Mana Theory (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Mana Theory (Tier 2) Level 1! 
Congratulations! Beginner Intuitive Problem Solving (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Intuitive Problem Solving (Tier 2) Level 1! Wisdom has increased by 1!

Marcus took a few deep breaths before turning his eyes to the Guide. “Now what?”
“Now I help you evolve your Basic Meditation skill,” she replied. “Begin by entering meditation, but try to split your focus to include my voice. If I have to intrude on you mentally to instruct you it will be more difficult.”
He closed his eyes and sank into his meditation, falling into the flow of his mana while forcing himself to also listen to the world around him. It took several minutes of effort for him to become aware of sound without losing his focus on his mana. 
“Good, very good,” he heard the Guide speak softly from what seemed like a great distance. “Now, instead of following the mana through your pathways, try to widen your focus like you did when you spread your senses through the test chamber. Try to feel all of your mana at once. Instead of becoming part of the flow, become one with the entire flow.”
Part of Marcus boggled at the thought. How was he supposed to become one with his mana? He had learned to follow the mana flows by imagining himself as a leaf carried along on a stream, something his conscious mind could wrap itself around to anchor it within the flow. But to become the flow? That was something else entirely. He cast around for a way to conceptualize it. Something he could comprehend…
The idea hit him suddenly, dissolution! He flowed the stream until he reached his core once more and instead of continuing onward, he submerged himself in the core, feeling the energy coursing around him. He pictured himself slowly dissolving like sugar in tea. Melting and diffusing through his core. Being spread throughout his pathways by the flow until there was no part of his mana flow that he wasn’t in. The feeling was intense and overwhelming at first. He struggled to both retain his sense of self and his diffuse state simultaneously. He groped through the sensation centimeter by centimeter, moment by moment until he began to understand. Until he finally realized he had infused his will, his intent, into the entire stream. It was no longer something alien to his soul, it was mere another part of him, like an arm or a leg. He could manipulate every part of it as if it were merely another set of muscles. 
Of course, like any set of muscles that had never been exercised, it was weak. He would need time and practice to exercise those muscles. To grow [stronger] and exert meaningful control. If he ever wanted to push his mana compression further, he would need for this particular “muscle” to get much, much [stronger.] And so he began, squeezing the entire system with all of his currently feeble might, then relaxing. He repeated this process again and again. He kept at it until a deep throbbing ache began to build in his awareness and he realized just how fatigued his consciousness felt.
Crap! He realized that he’d expended all the mental energy he’d had left on this process and began pulling himself back together. Concentrating his awareness back into a singular consciousness. Thankfully, that turned out to be easier than he feared given his exhausted state. Finally he opened his eyes blearily and crawled back into his bedroll before passing out. </Text>

            <Text>With nine hours left to until the beginning of the next evaluation, Marcus sat up and composed himself into a proper meditation position before pulling up his status screen once again. [REST? Bathroom? Food?]

His stats and resource pools had increased quite a bit from the beginning of the process and his skills list had expanded tremendously. He also figured that his title list was probably pretty good. Seven titles with around three days remaining in the introduction seemed pretty good.
“Your progress has been quite impressive so far,” the Guide stated as he closed his status screen. “Your performance thus far is likely to unlock some interesting paths for you, especially if you perform this well in the final evaluation.”
“I assume the next set of evaluations will focus on mental attributes?” He was pretty sure he knew the answer, but it never hurt to verify.
“Essentially yes,” she replied. “It will put you through a series of tests and trials meant to instill some skills that will improve your mental stats as they develop. While these trials will be considerably longer than any of the previous evaluations, they will be far less physically demanding for the most part.” The Guide tilted her head as she considered him again. “You will, however want to recoup your mana and stamina as you will need mana for the first evaluation cycle.”
Marcus nodded and began meditating to restore his mana and stamina. 

Rest period duration remaining  11:03:43

Marcus submerged himself deeply into his meditation, losing himself in the mana flowing within his body. He shut off all of his notifications and just focused. While he knew time was passing, he was almost completely unaware of it. He felt the notifications building up as his meditation skill leveled and he could watch his mana core refill. It took more than three hours to completely refill his mana pool, which regenerated much more slowly than stamina. Even with his mana core refilled, he continued to focus on refining his meditation skills. After quite a few hours, he exited meditation and opened his last few notifications.

Rest period duration remaining 5:19:59
Congratulations! Journeyman Mana Control (Tier 5) has improved to Level 5!
Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) has improved to Level 28! 

With his mana pool refilled, he shifted his focus to another goal he had wanted to pursue, attempting to create a magic spell. He began by considering how the staff he had used during the dexterity evaluation had converted his mana into a destructive bolt. He had spent two full hours using the implement and becoming familiar with the construct within the staff. With concentration and focus, he began to gather up some mana and manipulate it the way the staff had. It took a long time for Marcus to figure out how to shape the mana correctly, but once he started to make progress it sped up quickly. As a crackling bolt of destructive energy coalesced above his hand, he received another System notification.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Unguided Mana Bolt (Tier 1) Level 1! Wisdom has increased by 1!
Congratulations! You have created your first spell before choosing your path!
You have gained the title ‘Spellcrafting Prodigy’.  All spells and abilities you create are improved by 10% in power and efficiency.
Rest period duration remaining 2:09:22 

He grinned widely and sent the bolt zipping into the wall of the room where it dissipated without noticeable effect. He engaged the skill and a second bolt appeared instantly. This one significantly improved from his first, feeble attempt, though at a much greater mana cost. When he fired it at the wall it burst in a flare of destructive energy that left a slight scorch mark on the wall which faded quickly. He flung several more bolts as he further tested the ability before checking his mana.

Mana: 133/238

Without the help of the staff, each bolt he used consumed 20 mana after the discounts and boosts from his progress and prodigy titles. Clearly the enchantments on the staff to amplify mana were far more efficient than his method at this point. Still, he had his first offensive ability and had managed to create it entirely on his own. He was somewhat curious why the new skill had improved his wisdom though.
“So why do things like creating a new ability or evolving my meditation skill improve my wisdom?” He turned his eyes to the Guide as he asked the question.
“As I explained earlier, wisdom is linked to both your intuition and your ability to understand esoterica. The ability you created was not forged out of your knowledge of magical theory,” The Guide explained. “It was assembled from your experience with the staff you used and you own intuitive grasp of mana manipulation, ergo it was a display of your wisdom, not your intelligence. Meditation is about introspection, and the form of meditation you have learned so far is deeply tied to your grasp of mana, therefore it, too, is tied to your wisdom.”
Marcus considered the explanation for a few long moments. “So if I had based the creation of this ability on knowledge I had gained from studying magical theory in the abstract, that would have tied the creation to my intelligence?”
“Essentially, yes.”
“And if I used a different meditative technique, one not linked to my internal mana flows? That might also have a different stat tied to it?”
“Depending on what the technique was focused on, it is quite possible.” She agreed instantly. “Some martial paths, for example, have meditative techniques tied to the movement of the body through forms. Such a technique might be linked to agility or dexterity instead of wisdom.”
“That makes sense,” he nodded in understanding. “So how you get to a particular destination is at least as important as the destination itself when it comes skills and abilities.”
“Essentially, yes.”
“Thanks for the clarification. I’d better get some more meditation in, I expended rather a good chunk of mana creating that ability.” Marcus closed his eyes and settled back into his meditation, part of his mind already considering what he needed in order to create the other ability he wanted.</Text>

            <Text>Rest period duration remaining: 0:02:29

Marcus opened his eyes, pulled back to awareness by his Guide, exactly as he’d requested. Being conscious was the key to enduring the evaluation after all, especially with how dense the mana would get in the later stages of each cycle. He resumed his meditative position and focused once more on his breath control.
The first few cycles had been the worst as his body struggled with the foreign mana being flooded into him. The entire duration of that first cycle had been akin to sitting inside a blast furnace with temperature steadily increasing. From the very first moment, it had felt like the air around him had been set aflame. Every breath had felt like it scorched him inside and out. It was pure torture. And just when he was certain he would die if it got any more intense, it suddenly slackened and he could tolerate it once more.
During the first break, the Guide had begun teaching him. Teaching him to perceive the mana in the air as more than just scouring pain. To explore it’s nature to identify its elemental affinities. Just as he had begun to grasp these lessons, the break period ended and the intensity began to climb again. That second cycle had been even more hellish, lasting for what felt like an eternity of torment packed into just half an hour. But he’d endured, and more than that he’d put the Guide’s lessons to work and discovered yet another facet of the system.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Mana Sense (Tier 1) Level 1!

The message had surprised him so much that he’d almost lost his concentration. Thankfully he’d pulled himself back and regained his focus only to be surprised again a few moments later when another message appeared.

Congratulations! Beginner Mana Sense (Tier 1) has improved to Level 2!

And so it had continued with skill steadily improving every few minutes as the intensity continued to ramp up, far beyond what it had reached during the previous cycle. Until, again, just as he reached the point where he was sure he couldn’t handle anymore, the cycle had ended and the mana density instantly dropped back to its resting level with a final System message.

Congratulations! Beginner Mana Sense (Tier 1) has improved to Level 10!
Rest period duration remaining 0:14:59

[Immediately the Guide began expanding on the previous lesson, teaching him to feel the mana within his own body as well. To sense the differences between his own natural mana and the external mana, and to understand what those differences meant.] He was just beginning to really feel the mana inside himself, to feel it flowing throughout his body, when the next cycle began. And again, as the mana density began climbing past it’s previous peak, he was greeted with a new System message.

Congratulations! Beginner Mana Sense (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Mana Sense (Tier 2) Level 1!

And so the process had continued, with his ability to sense mana growing stronger and his understanding of the mana deepening. He learned that his internal mana was purer than the external mana, having been stripped of its elemental affinities and impurities. It was that difference in the nature of the mana around him and within him that caused him pain with each breath. Each time he inhaled he pulled that harsher external mana into himself, drawing it along his pathways to clash with the mana in his core. Some of it was absorbed and purified in his core. He then exhaled the portion that had not been purified and repeated the process. Throughout the period his Comprehensive Mana Sense had climbed through the levels just like his Basic Mana Sense had until the evaluation period ended.

Congratulations! Basic Mana Sense (Tier 2) has improved to Level 10!
Break period duration remaining 0:29:59

The third break was longer, and the Guide used it to begin teaching him how to visualize and manipulate the mana he was inhaling, speeding up the purification process and reducing the discomfort. Before the break period even ended, he managed to acquire a new System skill. And so the process had continued, with Marcus being tutored by the Guide on breaks, learning and improving skills related to the mana around and within him until had acquired a handful of such abilities, each building on the last until finally he got the mother of all all skill notices.

Congratulations! You have reached Tier 3 in all foundational Mana skills! Your foundational Mana skills have merged into Apprentice Mana Control (Tier 4) Level 1!
That had been achieved just as the last evaluation finished. For the first time since this ordeal began, the Guide had nothing to teach him during the break period, allowing him to actually rest for most of 75 minutes. He had completely lost track of how long he’d been at this, and was riding the edge of physical and mental exhaustion. [However, the time spent was beyond worthwhile.] [NUMBERS GO UP DOPAMINE] He had achieved a breakthrough when he acquired the Mana Control skill, having managed to compress his Mana core so tightly that it had collapsed, vastly increasing the density of his internal Mana and more than doubling the amount of mana he could comfortably contain within it. A feat that earned him a set of even more impressive System messages.

Congratulations! You Mana Core compression has increased from Tier 0 to Tier 1!
Mana drawn from your core has increased in potency.
Mana pool has increased by an additional 100% over it’s Tier 0 value.
Congratulations! You accomplished the first compression of your Mana Core before choosing a path!
You have earned the title ‘Mana Control Prodigy’. Title increases the effectiveness of all Mana Control Skills and abilities by 10%
Congratulations! You are the first sapient in your Universe to be recognized as a Prodigy!
You have earned the title ‘Universal Prodigy’. Title increases the effect of all current and future Prodigy titles by an additional 10%
Congratulations! You are the first sapient in your Universe to acquire a title!
You have earned the title ‘Universal Front Runner’. Title increases all stats by 10% and increases primary stats by an additional 5% for a total of 15%.

While he had no idea what his stats were, or which would be considered ‘primary’, he had to believe that boosting them all by 10 or 15% had to be a good thing. He knew from direct experience that the 20% boost to the effect of his Mana Control had made purifying and circulating his new, dense mana far easier. So much so, in fact, that he wanted to try to achieve a second compression, in hopes of gaining another title related to his Mana Control. Whether he succeeded or not, even the attempt would push his Mana Control skill to improve after all.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.

Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.

Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>Magic</Title>
            <Text>“Yes. Any application of mana is a form of magic as mana is what fuels magic.” The Guide pursed her lips and then explained. “Spells are one form of magic. Skills can also be magic in nature, expending mana to perform an action that might otherwise be impossible, though these are generally referred to as abilities rather than skills. Rituals and formations are also methods of performing magic and using ambient magic and external foci to accomplish something more complex than what you can do with spells or abilities.”
“So can you learn spells, rituals and formations without needing a skill or ability from the system? Or is magic strictly learned through the System?” Marcus mentally crossed his fingers that his brain was on the right track.
“Did the system teach you a spell or ability to compress your Mana Core?” she asked pointedly.
“No. No it did not.” He couldn’t quite keep the smile off his face. “I figured that out all by lonesome.”
[“Then why would the System be the only way you could learn magic?” She arched her eyebrow at him. “You learned to sense and control mana from what you were taught, not from the System just granting you a skill. You gained the skill from advancing your ability with the basic techniques.”][THE ROBOT IS SARCASTIC??]
“So all I need to learn to magic is to learn techniques for applying mana?” he asked.
“Or to create a technique to apply mana and accomplish an action with it,” she countered. “New magic abilities and spells are created everyday, throughout the Multiverse. The only thing holding you back is time, effort and understanding of fundamental concepts.”
“Wait, so all I have to do is figure out how to make mana do something I want it do and then do it?”
“Essentially, yes.”
“That’s why acquiring Mana Control was such a big deal! Because it doesn’t just make using magic easier, it makes creating new magic easier!” He exclaimed as realization dawned. If that was true, then his titles were even more valuable than he thought.
“Yes.”
Holy crap. His status as a Mana Control Prodigy positioned him to become very, very good at magic. “Okay, how can I gain an understanding of fundamental concepts then?”
“To gain an understand of the fundamental concepts of magic? Study how mana interacts with the world around it and experiment with altering those interactions. Or choose a path that gives you a basic knowledge of those concepts.” The Guide smiled as they laid out his options. “As to understanding how magic interacts with the fundamental concepts of reality? That is only learned through observation, experimentation and enlightenment.”
Marcus considered for a few long silent minutes, digesting what she said. “Fundamental concepts of reality? What does that even mean?”
[“In your culture some things, like gravity, sound, light, and distance, were considered physical laws, phenomena, or constants. They were largely immutable. The always behaved in predictable ways and you were able to theorize why and produce consistent experimental results under controlled circumstances.” The Guide asked. ][You are familiar with these concepts, correct?]
“For the most part, yes,” he answered after some careful consideration. “I mean when you got into the realm of very, very small objects a lot of our scientific conjecture and assumptions went out the window, but that just required further study to understand what was different and why. And I think some other fields may have had similar issues where they found circumstances that invalidated all previous assumptions and theories in certain cases.”
The Guide nodded. “Magically speaking, Gravity is a concept. An idea. Not a natural law, not an immutable fact. It applies most of the time, but if you understand the concept of Gravity, you can use mana to alter how it works. To change the rules. The same applies to most such things. If you understand Light, you can use mana to change the way it works, or Sound, or almost anything else.”
Marcus swallowed hard as he processed that. “So if I understand a… what did you call them? Concepts?”
The Guide nodded.
“If I understand a concept well enough, I can use mana to alter that concept? Permanently?” That was a terrifying thought.
“Yes, though the mana expenditure to permanently alter a fundamental concept even in a small, fairly localized space would be enormous. To do it on a larger scale would increase that expenditure exponentially.” She considered. “Few mortals would be able to accomplish such a thing. Even most deific powers would be able to do that on only a limited scale.”
Okay, there are apparently deific powers in the Multiverse, file that away for later consideration… Otherwise, magic seemed extremely powerful, if one delved into the proper concepts and understood them. Normally, in games, Marcus tended to steer away from using magic. It almost always seemed to be to too limited, especially early on, with restrictions on what you could do with it. This though… this was entirely different. This was the kind of power where the right knowledge could be literally earthshaking. And better yet, he was good at one of the most basic aspects of it. But did that mean…
“One more question before I move on to something else,” he spoke a little more slowly than he usually did as he continued. “Am I right in understanding I don’t need a specific, related path to do anything I want with magic?”
“Yes. While related paths will likely provide System-assisted skills and abilities and even System-provided knowledge to make the use of magic faster and easier, it is in no way required to use mana.” The Guide considered for a moment before adding, “That does not mean that everyone has the required skills or talent to use magic, however. While the Introduction will attempt to teach everyone basic techniques for sensing mana, it only teaches the more advanced techniques to those who can fully grasp the basics. For those who cannot, the Guides instead teach a different set of techniques to help inure them to mana exposure and how to breathe without drawing in mana in the process.”
So the Introductions were indeed adjusted based on the individual. He had assumed as much after the System cranked up the difficulty on his last evaluation cycle, but it was good to see it confirmed. The fact that what was taught changed as well was also good to know. He wouldn’t find himself being forced to learn something he was truly inept at. Probably. 
With a thought, he brought up the System notifications window to see how much time he had left before the next evaluation would begin.

Initiating Second Evaluation in 02:26:43

The timer brought a smile to his face, his conversation so far hadn’t been as long as he thought. That gave him time to experiment a little. As he moved to sit down, he was immediately reminded of something he had almost forgotten. He was still stark naked. “Uh, I don’t suppose you could provide me with clothes by any chance? While I had kinda gotten distracted by everything else, I don’t normally run around in the nude…”
Marcus could swear the Guide smirked at him as she waved her hand the way she had when conjuring his bedroll. A small bundle of what looked surprisingly like tan linen cloth appeared at his feet. Bending to examine it closer, it turned out to be a pair of linen drawstring pants, a loose, half-sleeved linen tunic, a pair of boxers made of what looked and felt like raw silk, and a pair of thin sandals that looked like they were made of leather.
He quickly started dressing himself, only for a thought to occur to him. “You could have done that at any time, couldn’t you?”
“Yes.”
There was that little smirk again, he was sure of it this time. “So you just let me stay naked?”
“Essentially yes.”
“Why?”
“You didn’t ask for clothes sooner,” she replied deadpan.
He closed his eyes and winced inwardly. “So I’ve been naked this whole time because I was too dumb to ask for clothes?”
“Essentially yes.”
Grumbling to himself, Marcus finished dressing and sat cross-legged on the floor. The clothes were surprisingly comfortable and did little to impede movement. He spent another few long minutes considering everything he’d seen and learned so far. The System wasn’t overtly antagonistic but it didn’t appear to go out of its way to be helpful either. It answered relevant questions when asked, but didn’t start those conversations or suggest topics directly. It would provide things like bedding and clothes, but only in response to specific input from him… 
“Are there any other techniques you can teach me before the next evaluation?” It was certainly worth a shot at any rate. 
The Guide paused again and this time he was almost positive she was querying the System. “Since you performed exceptionally in the first evaluation and have requested it, I can reward you by teaching you a meditation technique.”</Text>

            <Title>Physical Evaluation - Strength</Title>
            <Text>Rest period duration remaining 0:00:59
Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) has improved to 4!
Congratulations! Journeyman Mana Control (Tier 5) has improved to 2!

Marcus snapped out of his meditation in response to the one minute warning, rising smoothly to his feet. He quickly checked his stamina to find it almost fully restored, [proving the value of meditation to recovery at this point.]

Stamina: 80/83

He had regained a full 40 stamina over about seven and a half minutes. That was a touch more than 5 stamina a minute. Given his current stamina pool that meant he could fully regenerate his stamina pool from almost empty in about 15 minutes or so of meditation. He could only hope the speed improved as his stamina pool deepened.
Pushing the distractions aside, he turned his mind to the approaching tests. These tests were about pure strength and stamina for the most part as only the deadlift required anything much in the way of technique or form. [Luckily, he knew how to deadlift, so he wasn’t too worried about injuring himself.]

Beginning Third Evaluation Cycle

Instantly a barbell with two large seeming weights appeared on the floor in front of him. Without hesistating, Marcus positioned himself properly, grasped the bar, and stood, smoothly lifting the weight he held. He paused at the top before lowering it back down smoothly. As he moved to repeat the lift, he immediately noticed the barbell had significantly increased in weight when he set it down. Yet he continued to smoothly repeat the lift, with the weight increasing each time. After his third rep he got his first notification.

Congratulations! Skill learned: Beginner Lifting (Tier 1) Level 1! Strength has increased by 1!

Marcus immediately noticed the difference in his next rep, the increase of strength was quite noticeable, and the increase after each rep did not seem nearly as steep. He continued to lift, turning off notifications for anything other than new skills or evolutions. As the weight increased to the point where lifting became a significant strain, he got his second notification.

Congratulations! Beginner Lifting (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Lifting (Tier 2) Level 1! Strength has increased by 1!
Warning: Stamina has dropped below 25%!
Stamina: 22/94

He strained and managed two more reps before hitting what his drill instructors had termed muscle failure. He simply couldn’t repeat the exercise properly anymore, his arms feeling more akin to wet noodles than human limbs. He released the dumbbell, [stepped back, and stepped back a couple steps] before settling in and beginning to meditate, trusting the Guide would wake him when his 15 minutes between tests expired.
Marcus’s eyes snapped open, pulling him from his meditation as the Guide announced, “Next test begins in one minute.”

Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) has improved to Level 10!
Stamina: 94/94

Fourteen minutes of deep meditation and he saw six increases in level, which wasn’t bad, leaving him about halfway to the minimum level for its next evolution. Still he was back to peak stamina and his arms felt fully recovered so it wasn’t like it wasn’t effective enough for now as it was. He stood and did a couple quick stretches, looking for stiffness in his arms, legs or back and finding none. 
Suddenly the room changed and he found himself in what looked like a hallway perhaps 25 meters long. Before him sat what looked like a standard medicine ball one might find in a well equipped gym, only made of what looked like metal instead of rubber.
“Lift the ball, carry it to the line at the opposite end of the hall, put it down then repeat to return to this end,” the Guide instructed.
With a nod, Marcus lifted the ball using a modified deadlift, where he slid his hands under the rounded bottom of the ball and pulled it up into his chest before standing fully. It wasn’t as heavy as the first barbell repetition, but his strength had increased twice since then. He walked smoothly to the opposite end of the hall, turned around and repeated the motions to lower the ball to the floor. When he lifted it back to his chest, the weight seemed to have almost doubled. 
He repeated the process, the ball growing incrementally heavy with each repetition of the exercise. After just two reps he got a notification that surprised him so much he almost dropped the ball.

Congratulations! Beginner Athleticism (Tier 1) Level 10 has evolved to Basic Athleticism (Tier 2) Level 1!  Agility, Strength and Endurance have each increased by 1!

Apparently lifting and carrying increased both his Lifting and Athleticism skills, which made a strange sort of sense, considering the term was generally used to refer to a combination of strength, fitness and agility. He continued on repeating his exercises until finally, after about 30 minutes of effort he hit the wall, his arms gave out and he dropped the medicine ball. 

Warning! Stamina below 5%!
Stamina: 3/105 
If Stamina reaches 0 you will fall unconscious!

Marcus half-sat and half-collapsed to the floor, far more exhausted than he had been after any of the previous physical tests. It hadn’t fully occurred to him that hitting zero stamina would result in passing out, but he truly believed it now. Still he forced himself into a meditation position and began to meditate once more. Within just a few minutes of meditation, he felt greatly improved. When the Guide woke him he felt more than adequately recovered for a good performance on the next test.

Congratulations! Basic Meditation (Tier 2) has improved to Level 15!
Stamina: 98/105

Ninety-five stamina recovered in 14 minutes… That was more than he expected. In fact, that was almost seven stamina per minute, a noticeable increase from the bit more than five per minute he had been getting at first. He wondered if it was related to his stamina pool improving, his strength improving or his meditation skill improving. He’d have to ask the Guide about regeneration rates the next chance he got.
Standing he stretched and prepared mentally for the next task, swinging his arms and twisting his back to make sure the muscles were loosened up and ready. And then he suddenly found himself standing on a smooth, packed dirt track in front of a large metal cube that looked to be about one cubic meter. Attached to the center of the cube facing him was a drag line some three inches in diameter with a sturdy metal handle affixed to the loose end. 
Marcus scooped up the line, turned his back to the cube with the line over his right shoulder and both hands on the handle. He started walking at a slow but steady pace until the line went taut and then leaned his whole body into it. He took one steady step at a time, trying to distribute the drag weight across his whole body. And then he just kept moving. His feet felt like they were digging into the surface beneath him, providing a measure of bracing for each step and he just focused completely on each step. The minutes dragged on and the weight increased in steady increments. As he neared his limit and his stamina dropped steadily, he received another surprising notification.

Warning! Stamina below 5%
Stamina 4/99
Congratulations! Basic Athleticism (Tier 2) Level 20 has evolved to Novice Athleticism (Tier 3) Level 1! Agility, Strength and Endurance have each increased by 1!
Warning! Stamina below 15%!
Stamina: 15/116

Apparently a stamina pool increase resulted in an equal increase in current stamina. That skill evolution bought him enough stamina to push through one final step.  

Warning! Stamina critical!
Stamina: 1/116
Congratulations! Novice Athleticism has improved to Level 2!

Marcus dropped the drag line and dropped to his knees, sinking into meditation almost immediately.
