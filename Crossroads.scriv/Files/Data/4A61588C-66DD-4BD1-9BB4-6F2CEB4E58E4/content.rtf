Not immediately and not all at once, but the events of that fall ended my life as surely as if it had been a bullet in my brain. My name is Mitchell Whitaker and I was born in a dying town in the coal fields of Appalachia. Like more than a few of my peers, my parents weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bad people, just weak people born into a time and place that was about as unkind to them as it could be. Dad got hurt working in the mines and got hooked on pills. Mom ended up an addict right alongside him. By the time I was ten, I was being raised by my grandmother and hadn\u8217\'92t seen my folks in a couple years.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I found the book on Saturday, May 17, 1986, just 4 days after my fourteenth birthday. I was helping Gran clean up in the attic when we came across a very old hope chest that had belonged to Gran\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own Grandmother. It must have been in that attic since before my mother was born, based on how buried in junk it had been and how thick the dust was. }}
